There've been a lot of sex stories recently. Or rather a lot of sexual harassment stories. Not surprisingly they are all quite grubby and they tend to show the worst in human nature.
Take the news in Alabama this week - it's a textbook case. An older guy in a powerful position is accused by women of molesting them when they were teenagers. One of the women says she was only 14.
Roy Moore is now 70 years old and running to be the next US senator for the state of Alabama. Some polls suggest he could win.
There is also a report in the New Yorker magazine that Mr Moore was banned from visiting a local shopping mall because of his tendency to badger teenage girls there. It takes quite a bit to be banned from a shopping mall.
There have now been a slew of these types of stories. I sincerely hope they do change our culture, especially for all the women who work in industries where the men aren't famous and so are less likely to be outed, and for the women who are so financially dependent on their jobs that they can't afford to turn down their lecherous bosses.
But the story of Judge Roy Moore in Alabama has revealed something else that has nothing to do with sex and harassment. It's a story of tribalism.
Over the past few days Mr Moore has been widely condemned by many top Republican politicians in Washington who say he should drop out of the Senate race.
They say they believe the accusers stories over Mr Moore's denials. But the reaction in Alabama itself has been quite different.

There, several state Republican officials and local Republican party committees have come to Judge Moore's defence.
Ed Henry, a Republican state representative, suggested it's the women who accused Mr Moore who should be prosecuted, for not coming forward with their stories sooner and so allowing an accused predator to roam free. Seriously.
And Jerry Pow, the Republican chairman of Bibb County, Alabama, told a reporter he'd vote for Roy Moore even if the allegations are true, and he did commit a sex crime against a teenager.
Take a breath and let that sink in for a moment - it's 2017 and an Alabama Republican official says he'd vote for a paedophile.
What's so revealing in the context of tribalism is Mr Pow's reasoning. He'd vote for Moore, he says, because he can't bring himself to vote for the Democrat in the race.
Jerry Pow believes any Democrat is de facto worse than any Republican - even if that Republican molested girls and then lied about it.
This is a whole step beyond the realm of fake news. This is taking facts, chucking them out with the trash and quite happily forming your own opinions based on nothing more flimsy than pure prejudice.
To the extent that tribalism comes from the top, it's worth noting President Trump has been conspicuously quiet on the subject of Republican Roy Moore, but tweeted scathing comments about Democrat Al Franken.
The Republican Governor of Alabama has added her voice to those saying she believes the women but will vote for Mr Moore nonetheless, to get another Republican in the Senate.
And here's the kicker. According to researchers, we are all prone to doing just that. You, me, our friends, our kids, our news editors, and yes, the good people of Alabama.
Political scientists have known this about us for years. In 2010, a landmark study by two psychologists showed that facts fails to sway our opinions. Indeed, Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler argued that fact-checking can actually make us more entrenched in our political biases.
When someone presents us with evidence contrary to our beliefs, we feel under siege and dig in our heels. That is what seems to be happening this week in Alabama.
In the context of Donald Trump, political scientists have recently discovered that voters aren't stupid - they are actually quite capable of recognising that a politician is lying. But it doesn't change the way they feel about him.
This is getting more extreme because politics has become not just polarised but tribal. We hunker down in groups of like-minded people and then we fight to protect that group.
As the political atmosphere grows more toxic, fuelled by social media that has made the debate more personal and vicious, we feel we have to fight even harder to protect our crowd.
That means relentlessly attacking the opposing camp and refusing to budge from our opinions in the face of inconvenient truths, like the possibility that someone we support is actually a child molester.
I want to think Jerry Pow, the Alabama state representative, was being disingenuous and that he doesn't really believe a Republican paedophile is better than any Democrat.
I want to think that because the alternative is just too alarming, for all of us, whatever our beliefs.

Every woman dreams of a workplace where her boss doesn't suggest they grab a drink after work, where there isn't that colleague you'd just rather not get stuck in the office with alone and where your job prospects don't depend, however subtly, on whether you put up with lascivious comments from a man who has power over you.
That dream today looks tantalisingly close and many of us are daring to hope the current rash of sexual harassment stories will help us get there. We've been through moments like this before and been disappointed - maybe not this time.
Our goal is simple. We want a workplace that is safe for all of us. Where suggestive comments or acts aren't tolerated. Where men making women feel uncomfortable is totally unaccepted. And where people in positions of power can never use that power to ask for sexual favours.
Women are conscious that it's not enough to achieve this in a few high profile industries where the men are famous and therefore more likely to be outed.

The tip-dependent waitress who goes to work every evening shouldn't have to smile and put up with the unwanted advances of drunk customers. The check-out woman at the local super market shouldn't have to put up with the comments, or pats, or squeezes of her lecherous manager in order to ensure she gets enough shifts that week.
The nurse in your local hospital shouldn't have to worry about whether the supervisor on the lonely graveyard shift is going to push himself up against her yet again and then pretend nothing happened.
That's the world so many women navigate every single day. I honestly do not know a woman, in any profession, at any level, who has not at some point, often at many points, had to repudiate the unwanted advances of a man they've worked with or for. We shouldn't have to.
With this new focus on male predators, we aren't out to destroy careers. This is not revenge we seek. It's just safety and respect and the freedom to do our jobs without having to deal with this kind of crap.
I'm older and more senior now so it doesn't happen to me much anymore. Predators don't go for women with power of their own - they prey on the vulnerable. On women who depend on the pay check, or women who are eager, quite rightly, to advance their careers, or on women they can trust will keep quiet, for whatever reason. Those are the women we want to protect now.
My concern is that there could be a backlash that sets us back in that quest.

These stories have revealed a gender knowledge gap - women know a lot about this issue and men are hardly aware of it. This is simply because the vast majority of men are good, decent people who would never molest a woman and because straight men are rarely on the receiving end of harassment.
There's already some disconnect between men and women in the press coverage of this story. My female colleagues are without exception excited to see this issue finally come to light. Some of my male colleagues are more uncomfortable, or feel we've covered it enough.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Female journalists, like these White House reporters, are more willing to devote coverage to these stories
If there are many more of these stories, at what point will people start to roll their eyes and ask, "another sexual harassment story, really?" If that starts to happen, then this will just be another women's moment, not a lasting change.
There's some indication of that in response to the Al Franken story.
One conservative commentator has made the point that Franken has apologised, unlike Judge Roy Moore in Alabama. Another has suggested there's no need for an investigation because of Franken's apology.

I confess I don't know how we respond to the issue of degrees of harassment and degrees of apology. Is all harassment equal? Are all apologies enough?
When a man is accused multiple times of harassing children and still doesn't apologise, the case for condemnation seems clear. But are there grey areas?

I read Al Franken's apology and found it heartfelt, full of regret and credible. But that doesn't negate the fact that the senator from Minnesota forcibly stuck his tongue in a woman's mouth and she was left feeling disgusted and dirty.
If he stays in office, what message does that send to our daughters, or to other predators?
Actually the woman who's come out with this story isn't asking for Al Franken to step down and she recognises that times and standards have changed. But she did want her account and her photo out to protect women now.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hours after Franken (left) was accused, Senator Gillibrand said Bill Clinton should have resigned over his affair
And that's what matters - the goal of a safe workplace. This is a difficult conversation that we need to have among women but more importantly with our male colleagues. It's a conversation that's not going away because some men have repeatedly behaved badly for years and those stories will come out.
But perhaps that conversation will be easier and more productive if it's about a better future, something every man and woman and parent can hopefully agree to, not about retribution.
Maybe that's the way this #MeToo movement becomes more than just a #MeToo moment.

Do people moderate their views when presented with overwhelming evidence to the contrary? Not necessarily, writes Matthew Syed.
We like to think that we apportion our beliefs to the evidence. After all, isn't this the hallmark of rationality? When information comes along which reveals we should change our minds, we do.
Or do we?
Consider an experiment, where two groups were recruited. One group was adamantly in favour of capital punishment. They had strong feelings on the issue, and had publicly backed the policy. The other group were adamantly against, horrified by "state-sanctioned murder".
These groups were then shown two dossiers. Each of these dossiers were impressive. They marshalled well-researched evidence. But here's the thing. The first dossier collated all the evidence in favour of capital punishment. The second collated all the evidence against.

Now you might suppose that, confronted by this contradictory evidence, the two groups would have concluded that capital punishment is a complex subject with arguments on both sides. You might have expected them to have moved a little closer in their views. In fact, the opposite happened - they became more polarised.
When asked about their attitudes afterwards, those in favour of capital punishment said they were impressed with the dossier citing evidence in line with their views. The data was rigorous, they said. It was extensive. It was robust. As for the other dossier - well, it was full of holes, shoddy, weak points everywhere.
The opposite conclusions were drawn by those against capital punishment. It was not just that they disagreed with the conclusions. They also found the (neutral) statistics unimpressive. From reading precisely the same material, they became even more entrenched in their positions.
What this (and dozens of other experiments) reveal is the way we filter new information when it challenges our strongly-held beliefs or judgements. We use a series of post hoc manoeuvres to reframe anything inconvenient to our original position. We question the probity of the evidence, or the credentials of the people who discovered it, or their motives, or whatever. The more information that emerges to challenge our perspective, the more creatively we search for new justifications, and the more entrenched we become in our prior view.
This tendency is called "cognitive dissonance".
Image copyright iStock Image caption When beliefs are challenged by evidence, people may become more entrenched in those beliefs
You can see the hallmarks of cognitive dissonance in the build-up to and aftermath of the Iraq War. The Chilcot report made pointed criticisms over the legal advice, lack of cabinet oversight and post-war planning and policy. But let us focus on the way the primary evidence used to justify war - namely, the existence of WMD - was serially reframed.
On 24 September 2002, before the conflict, Tony Blair made a speech where he emphatically stated: "His [Saddam Hussein's] WMD programme is active, detailed and growing… he has existing plans for the use of weapons, which could be activated in 45 minutes…"
The problem with this claim is that Saddam's troops didn't use such weapons to repel Western forces, and the initial search for WMD drew a conspicuous blank. And yet, as the social psychologists Jeff Stone and Nicholas Fernandez have pointed out in an essay on the Iraq conflict, Blair didn't amend his view - he reframed the evidence. In a speech to the House of Commons, he said: "There are literally thousands of sites... but it is only now that the Iraq Survey Group has been put together that a dedicated team of people… will be able to do the job properly… I have no doubt that they will find the clearest possible evidence of WMD."
The Chilcot report

So, to Blair, the lack of WMD didn't show that they were not actually there. Rather, it showed that inspectors hadn't been looking hard enough. Moreover, he had become more convinced of the existence of WMD, not less so.
Twelve months later, when the Iraq Survey Group couldn't find the weapons either, Blair still couldn't accept that WMD were not there. Instead, he changed tack again arguing in a speech that "they could have been removed, they could have been hidden, they could have been destroyed".
So now, the lack of evidence for WMD in Iraq was no longer because troops hadn't had enough time to find them, or because of the inadequacy of the inspectors, but because Iraqi troops had spirited them out of existence.
Image copyright AP Image caption Tony Blair in Iraq after the 2003 invasion - failure to find WMDs did not change his mind
But this stance soon became untenable, too. As the search continued in a state of desperation, it became clear that not only were there no WMD, but there were no remnants of them, either. Iraqi troops could not have spirited them away.
And yet Blair now reached for a new justification for the decision to go to war. "The problem is that I can apologise for the information that turned out to be wrong, but I can't, sincerely at least, apologise for removing Saddam," he said in a speech. "The world is a better place with Saddam in prison."
This is not intended as argument against Blair - rather, as an illustration of the reach of cognitive dissonance. Indeed, when you read the Chilcot report, this tendency, not just with regard to WMD, peppers almost every page.
Image caption Chilcot report: Illustrations of cognitive dissonance "pepper" nearly every page
Science has changed the world because it prioritises evidence over conviction. Judgements are subservient to what the data tells us. The problem is that in many areas of our world, evidence is revised to fit with prior assumptions - and the tragedy is that we are often unaware of this process because it happens subconsciously. It is noteworthy, for example, that the Chilcot report nowhere states that Blair was actively deceitful.
The good news is that we can combat this tendency, and measurably improve our judgements, when we become alert to it. Indeed, the hallmark of pioneering institutions is that they deal with cognitive dissonance not by reframing inconvenient evidence, but by creating systems that learn from it (and thus avoid related biases such as "group think"). This should be the most important lesson of Chilcot.
Had non-intervention in Syria achieved peace, Blair would likely still have found a way to interpret that evidence through the lens of the rightness of his decision to invade Iraq
When so-called Islamic State launched a major offensive in Iraq in 2014, and the country was on the brink of a civil war - which some commentators linked to the 2003 invasion - Blair found another avenue of justification.
He pointed to the policy of non-intervention in Syria, which had descended into its own civil war. In an article written for his personal website, he said: "In Syria we called for the regime to change, took no action and it is in the worst state of all." In other words he might be suggesting: "If things look bad in Iraq now, they would have been even more awful if we had not invaded in 2003."
For our purposes, the most important thing is not whether Blair was right or wrong on this point, one which he re-affirmed this week. The vital thing to realise is that had non-intervention in Syria achieved peace, Blair would likely still have found a way to interpret that evidence through the lens of the rightness of his decision to invade Iraq. In fact, he would probably have become more convinced of its rightness, not less so.
And this is why the Chilcot report, despite its mammoth detail, will have little effect on the core judgements of those involved with the Iraq War. As with everything else, it will simply be reframed.

One week ago we were reporting from Alabama. An extraordinary Senate race is being played out in this Deep South state - between a Democrat, Doug Jones, and the Republican candidate Roy Moore.
Roy Moore has been called many things in his political life: a racist, a homophobe, a man who has said American Muslims shouldn't stand for office and that gay sex should be made illegal. He is considered to occupy a place far to the right of any other elected senator.
But all that paled briefly into the background this week after allegations emerged in the Washington Post - a number of women came forward to claim he had made unwanted sexual advances - including, one said, when she was just 14 years old.
A second woman claiming she'd been assaulted by him aged 16 has now come forward as I write this.
Roy Moore is not new to public office. He's twice been elected Alabama Supreme Court justice. He's twice been fired from that post - once for refusing to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from the Alabama Judicial Building.
The second time for directing judges to enforce the ban on same-sex marriage after state laws had overturned it.
This time around he has the backing of Steve Bannon, the arch strategist some credit with getting Trump into power. An ideologue who makes the president look like a moderate.
Democrats do not normally get a look-in in a redder-than-red state like Alabama. This time, though, it feels different. A growing number of Republicans there are supporting groups like Republicans for Doug, Republicans for Jones, GOP4DougJOnes and so on.

There is a nervousness from establishment Republicans about the way Moore is shifting their party to the extremes.
When we visited Roy Moore's tiny home town of Gallant, Alabama, we stumbled upon his relatives - still living in the place he grew up. His nephew - a policeman - was a Trump fan who said he'd only been interested in politics since Trump took office and would give it all up again the moment he left. He was keen to talk to us, but his wife quickly shut him down.
I understand better now why - the allegations of sexual assault against Moore were to surface less than 48 hours later.
At Doug Jones' office we got lucky, arriving there just as the Senate candidate himself turned up.
He granted us an interview and declared his rival "was going all out to divide people by race, sexuality, faith". He didn't hold back.
I messaged Moore's campaign manager - John Rogers - to tell him we had strong allegations from Doug Jones, and would he like to give Judge Moore a chance to respond. He came right back to me on text: What did he say? He wanted to know?
It struck me at the time that he responded too quickly. Now, once again, I see why - he believed I must have learned about the abuse claims. He wanted to hear what we knew.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The vote is on 12 December
Roy Moore has insisted despite these sex abuse allegations he will continue to run for office. Perhaps he learned from Donald Trump's playbook - the Access Hollywood tape during the campaign. If you just sit out the claims, and say nothing, it will all go away. The voters ultimately didn't make them an election issue for Trump. Why would they in Alabama?
This story is riveting on many levels - not least what it's doing to the Republican Party more widely.
Some local lawmakers in Alabama have said it's better to have a sexual predator in office than a Democrat. One fell back on a fairly unusual biblical interpretation to justify the allegation.
Jim Zeigler, the Alabama State Auditor, told the Washington Examiner: "Take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus. There's just nothing immoral or illegal here, maybe just a little bit unusual."
Yes, that's a direct quote.
Others have suggested bringing back the establishment Republican candidate Moore beat in the Senate primaries. Luther Strange, they say, could enter the race as a "write in" candidate - one who doesn't appear on the ballot sheet but who voters can add in themselves - if they get the spelling right.
This seems like a tremendous idea - to Democrats - who know that a confused electorate could pretty much hand the senate seat to Doug Jones himself.
Image caption Democrat Doug Jones is running against Moore
The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has called on Roy Moore to "step aside", without even waiting to find out if the allegations are true.
Will Moore's fans care about this top-down edict? Almost certainly not. McConnell has never seen eye to eye with either Bannon or Moore. For Moore loyalists, it makes their candidate into something of a hero - the little guy battling big beasts on BOTH sides of the house.
Moore himself has questioned the timing of these allegations - made three weeks before polling day - and broken by a paper he would call the Liberal Media. He's even accused the Republican and Democrat parties of working together.
And what do we learn from this? Well, much depends ultimately on the result of this Senate race on 12 December.
Democrats I've been talking to tell me they truly believe they will win the seat. I began by laughing out loud at that suggestion. Now I'm not so sure.
But my gut feeling tells me Moore will still pull this off - if he can continue convincing voters that this is fake news at work. And if he can make 30-year-old men dating teenagers sound normal. And if he can quote the Bible to do the rest of his work for him then yes, this is a storm in a Dean and Delucca teacup.
Because this is Alabama where a lot of the things that shock other parts of America don't seem so out of step. Moore has already proved this is a place where you can turn up to vote on a horse, claim Obama is not born of an American passport and believe the 911 attacks were divine retribution. And no one seems to bat an eyelid.
They've voted him into office twice before. Why should women making claims he chooses not to hear make this time any different?
Roy Moore: How Alabamans are defending the accused judge
"In the South, some of these girls look 20 and some look 14", says a supporter of the accused judge.

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe is to meet army chiefs amid intense pressure for him to step down.
Mediation will be led by a Catholic priest, state TV said. Mr Mugabe has largely been confined to his house since the army took over on Wednesday.
The governing Zanu-PF party is also meeting to discuss whether to dismiss their founder and long-term leader.
The army intervened after Mr Mugabe, 93, fired his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa.
Mr Mnangagwa's dismissal made Mr Mugabe's wife Grace front runner to become next president. He is likely to be reinstated as vice-president when Zanu-PF convene.
Mr Mugabe has led Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980.
Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets on Saturday to celebrate the army's takeover and to urge Mr Mugabe to quit.
They tore pictures of Mr Mugabe and marched to his office and residence.
The military says it will advise the public on the outcome of talks "as soon as possible".

Nine of 10 Zanu-PF party chapters say Mr Mugabe should step down and their decision is likely to be endorsed at Sunday's meeting of the party's top body, the central committee.
The BBC's Andrew Harding in Harare says this is a watershed moment and there can be no return to power for Mr Mugabe.
Our correspondent says the situation appears to be getting out of Zanu-PF's control and there could be a broad push to introduce a transitional government that includes the opposition.
Negotiating Mugabe's exit
Analysis by Anne Soy, BBC News, Harare
It is understood that President Mugabe has so far insisted that he cannot step down and so legitimise a coup.
The military maintains this is not a coup and there is international pressure to use constitutional means to resolve the political crisis. Negotiators are poring through Zimbabwe's laws to find a legal way out.
Saturday's call for civilians to take to the streets looks choreographed to lend some legitimacy to the transition process being discussed.
President Mugabe's support base has continued to crumble. Independence war veterans, who fought alongside him against colonial rule, have also called on their former leader to leave.
But the biggest blow yet to Mr Mugabe could be delivered by the central committee of his ruling Zanu-PF on Sunday. Their meeting could see Robert Mugabe dismissed as party leader.

The top nuclear commander in the US says he would resist any "illegal" presidential order to launch a strike.
Air Force Gen John Hyten, said as head of the US Strategic Command he provided advice to a president and expected that a legal alternative would be found.
His comments come just days after US senators discussed a president's authority to launch a nuclear attack.
Some of them expressed concern that President Donald Trump might irresponsibly order such a strike.
Others though said a president must have the authority to act without meddling from lawyers. It was the first such hearing in more than 40 years.
In August, Mr Trump vowed to unleash "fire and fury like the world has never seen" on North Korea if it threatened the US.
Last month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Republican chairman, Senator Bob Corker, accused the president of setting the US "on a path to World War Three".
Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada, Gen Hyten said: "We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?"
"I provide advice to the president, he will tell me what to do," he said.
"And if it's illegal, guess what's going to happen? I'm going to say: 'Mr President, that's illegal.' And guess what he's going to do? He's going to say, 'What would be legal?' And we'll come up with options, of a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that's the way it works.
"It's not that complicated," Gen Hyten added.

Jubilant scenes are unfolding on the streets of Zimbabwe's capital Harare, as protests demanding the resignation of President Robert Mugabe have turned to a celebration of the army's role in ending his grip on power.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anne Soy with jubilant protesters in Harare
A carnival mood has engulfed Zimbabwe's capital, Harare. Zimbabweans poured out to the streets carrying flags and placards to celebrate Wednesday's military takeover.
President Robert Mugabe is under intense pressure to resign. But nothing has been heard from the 93-year-old since he appeared at a university graduation on Friday.
"We want to tell President Mugabe, it is time to rest," Chipo tells us as she continues celebrating with her friends near Freedom Square. "This is a new Zimbabwe, and freedom has finally come," she adds.
Such a public display of defiance against the president would have been unthinkable before the military intervention.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Zimbabweans have been queuing to take pictures with the soldiers
Crowds erupt into celebration at the sight of military vehicles and soldiers.
"They have given us our second independence," shouts a man from a crowd surging towards an armoured personnel carrier.
The crowds sing songs praising the military and its chief, Gen Constantino Chiwenga. Some carry placards featuring the general's portrait and that of the former Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was fired last week after a feud with First Lady Grace Mugabe.
Negotiations are going on behind the scenes to persuade President Mugabe to step down.
It is understood that he has insisted that he cannot do so and legitimise a coup.
The military maintains this is not a coup and there is international pressure to use constitutional means to resolve the political crisis. Negotiators are poring through Zimbabwe's laws to find a legal way out.
Crumbling base
Image copyright EPA Image caption Mugabe's name and pictures have been taken down, stamped upon, torn
Saturday's call for civilians to take to the streets looks choreographed to lend some legitimacy to the transition process being discussed.
President Mugabe's support base has continued to crumble. Independence war veterans who fought alongside him against colonial rule have also been meeting in Harare. They, too, have called on their former leader to leave.
But the biggest blow yet to Mr Mugabe could be delivered by the central committee of the ruling Zanu-PF on Sunday.
State television, ZBC, reported that eight out of 10 provinces of the party have passed a vote of no confidence in the president. Sunday's meeting is expected to ratify their decision, a move that could see Robert Mugabe dismissed as party leader.
Back on the streets in the capital, car horns have been blaring all day as a few daring drivers attempt stunts amid cheers from spectators.
The feeling of freedom is palpable. There is a sense that Mr Mugabe's 37-year rule is coming to an end.
The majority of those in the streets are young people who have only ever known him as their leader, like 31-year-old Rachel, who took her children aged nine months and four years to Freedom Square. "I'm happy that she (pointing at the younger child strapped on her back) will grow up knowing a new president, not the one I've known all my life."
"We want change," says another young woman. "It doesn't matter what change, we just want it."
As celebrations continue into the night, it appears not much thought has been given to life after Robert Mugabe.
But there is growing consensus that the 93-year-old man has overstayed his welcome.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe is under house arrest after almost four decades in power - following a military takeover. Here are 10 numbers that will help you understand how the country got to where it is now.
1 = the tally of leaders in the last 37 years
President Mugabe, who led the country's liberation movement, has been in power since independence in 1980. He served first as prime minister until the switch to a presidential system in 1987.
Image copyright Reuters
But the 93-year-old leader's years in office have been marked by economic crisis and the crushing of dissent. He and his supporters have managed to stay in power for so long by using violence and murder as an electoral strategy.
231 million per cent = inflation in July 2008
Zimbabwe's economy has struggled since land reforms were introduced in 2000.
The programme that saw white-owned farms redistributed to landless black Zimbabweans - and those with good political connections - led to sharp falls in production.
As the country's central bank printed money to try to get out of the crisis, rampant inflation took hold.
Although the World Bank does not have figures for 2008 and 2009, numbers from Zimbabwe's central bank showed annual inflation reached 231 million % in July 2008. Officials gave up reporting monthly statistics when it peaked at just under 80 billion % in mid-November 2008.
The country was forced to abandon its own currency a year later at a rate of Z$35 quadrillion to US$1.
$16.3bn = GDP in 2016
The political and economic crises between 2000 and 2008 nearly halved Zimbabwe's GDP - the biggest contraction in a peacetime economy, according to the World Bank.
A brief period of recovery between 2009 and 2012 has now faltered and the economy faces serious challenges, says the World Bank. Growth has slowed sharply from an average 8% from 2009 to 2012, caused by shifts in trade and a series of major droughts.
President Mugabe has always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms.
74% = the population living on less than $5.50 a day
The country's political and economic crises have resulted in high poverty rates.
The hard years between 2000 and 2008 saw poverty rates increase to more than 72%, according to the World Bank. It also left a fifth of the population in extreme poverty.
Extreme poverty, estimated to have fallen from 2009 to 2014, is now projected to have risen again substantially.
About 27% of children under the age of five suffer stunted growth, with 9% severely stunted because of poor nutrition, the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey report revealed.
But poverty in Zimbabwe is still lower than in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, where about 41% of the population were living on less than $1.90 a day in 2013, World Bank data suggests.
90% = one estimate of the unemployment rate
Image copyright EPA
Estimates of the country's unemployment levels vary wildly.
The World Bank's modelled estimates based on the International Labour Organisation data puts the figure as low as 5% in 2016, while Zimbabwe's biggest trade union claims the jobless rate was as high as 90% this year.
However, the World Bank's definition only covers those actively "seeking" work. Many of those not counted may not seek a job despite wanting one because they "view job opportunities as limited, or because they have restricted labour mobility, or face discrimination, or structural, social or cultural barriers".
The CIA world factbook estimates the rate was 95% in 2009, but says current figures are not known.
89% = adult literacy rate
Due to large investments in education since independence, Zimbabwe has one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa, with 89% of the adult population literate, according to World Bank data from 2014.
Globally, the literacy rate stood at 86% in 2016, while in sub-Saharan Africa it was 64% (2015 figs).
Almost all women and men aged 15-49 have had at least some primary education, according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey. More than 70% of people aged 15-49 have also attended secondary school.
13.5% = the adult prevalence rate of HIV/Aids
Zimbabwe has the sixth highest HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.3 million people living with HIV in 2016, according to UNAIDS.
However, after a peak in 1997, rates are declining.
According to the UN, this is a result of successful campaigns encouraging condom use as well as programmes preventing the transmission of infection from mother to child. Treatment and support services have also improved.
60 = the life expectancy at birth
Life expectancy fell in the 1990s, with the HIV/Aids epidemic a major killer. It dropped from a high of 61.6 years in 1986 to 43.1 years in 2003.
It is now steadily improving again, but with unemployment and poverty endemic and HIV/Aids rates still high, it remained at just 60 in 2015, according to World Bank data.
81 = the number of mobile subscriptions per 100 people
Mobile devices are the leading communication tool for Zimbabweans.
But while most have a mobile phone, only 43% of households have a radio, 37% have a television and 10% have a computer, according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.
16.7 million = the current population
After a growth spurt after independence in 1980, a decline in birth rates and a rise in death rates saw population growth slide downwards.
With high outward migration rates also high, the population has not recovered its post-independence growth.

The Palestine Liberation Organisation has warned it will freeze its ties with the US if it carries out a threat to close the PLO office in Washington.
In a video on Twitter, PLO Secretary General Saeb Erekat called the move "unacceptable".
US officials say the PLO could be breaking a legal condition for it to operate in the US.
The US law says Palestinian authorities must not pressure the International Criminal Court to investigate Israelis.
The PLO, which is seen by the international community as representing all Palestinians, opened an office in DC in 1994.
It is the first time that the State Department has declined to reissue a six-monthly operating licence for it.
A state department official cited "certain statements made by Palestinian leaders" about the International Criminal Court (ICC) as the reason behind the non-renewal.
In September Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told the UN that the Palestinians had called on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate and prosecute Israeli officials over "involvement in settlement activities and aggressions against our people".
The State Department official said President Trump had 90 days to decide whether to let the PLO keep its office if he deems that the Palestinians have entered into "direct, meaningful negotiations with Israel".
Mr Abbas said he was "deeply surprised" by the US move, which he said had "dangerous consequences for the peace process and the American-Arab relations".
Mr Erekat said he believed the Israeli government had been putting pressure on the Trump administration "at a time when we are trying to co-operate to achieve the ultimate deal".
The Israeli government said it was a matter of US law, the Associated Press news agency reported.

Signals have been detected that are thought to have come from an Argentine submarine that went missing with 44 crew on board, officials say.
The defence ministry is now trying to trace the location of the seven failed satellite calls received on Saturday.
Argentina has stepped up the search in the South Atlantic for the ARA San Juan submarine, with a Nasa research plane joining in.
The diesel-electric vessel disappeared 430km (267 miles) off the coast.
Britain and countries in the region have offered assistance. The US Navy is flying deep water rescue modules to Argentina to be deployed if the submarine is found on the sea floor.
The task of the rescuers has been complicated by heavy winds and high waves.
Power cut?
The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, to its base at Mar del Plata, south of Buenos Aires.
Its last contact with the navy command was on Wednesday morning.
An Argentine destroyer and two corvettes are conducting a search around the area of the sub's last known position off the south-eastern Valdez peninsula.
But so far there are no clues about its whereabouts.
It is thought that the submarine may have had communication difficulties caused by a power cut.
Navy protocol dictates that a vessel should come to the surface if communication has been lost.

Australian guitarist and AC/DC co-founder Malcolm Young has died aged 64 after a long battle with dementia.
He died peacefully on Saturday with his family nearby, a statement said.
Young will be remembered for his powerful rhythm guitar riffs that were instrumental in propelling the Sydney heavy rock group to stardom.
Three Young brothers have been part of AC/DC's history, including lead guitarist Angus. Producer George Young died in October.

"Renowned for his musical prowess, Malcolm was a songwriter, guitarist, performer, producer and visionary who inspired many," the statement read.
"From the outset, he knew what he wanted to achieve and, along with his younger brother, took to the world stage giving their all at every show. Nothing less would do for their fans."

Fans and friends of Young have been posting their tributes to the popular musician on social media.
Tom Morello, of the US band Rage Against the Machine, tweeted his thanks to the "#1 greatest rhythm guitarist".
English rock star David Coverdale, a member of the band Whitesnake and former lead singer of Deep Purple, also offered his "thoughts and prayers".
After forming AC/DC in 1973, Angus and Malcolm Young were credited as co-writers on every song the band recorded between their 1975 debut High Voltage through to 2014's Rock or Bust.
Malcolm was born in 1953 in Glasgow before his family emigrated to Australia when he was 10.
His family confirmed he was suffering from dementia in 2014.
Image copyright PA Image caption Malcolm Young wrote some of AC/DC's best-known songs
He wrote much of the material that enabled AC/DC to become one of the biggest heavy rock bands and singer Brian Johnson has described him as the band's "spiritual leader, our spitfire".
Their biggest hits include Back in Black, Highway to Hell, and You Shook Me All Night Long. The group is estimated to have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the US.
A statement by Angus Young on the AC/DC website praises Malcolm's "enormous dedication and commitment" which made him "the driving force behind the band" who "always stuck to his guns and did and said exactly what he wanted".
"As his brother it is hard to express in words what he has meant to me during my life, the bond we had was unique and very special. He leaves behind an enormous legacy that will live on forever.
"Malcolm, job well done."
The band's backbone
Mark Savage, BBC Music reporter
Malcolm Young was never the star attraction of AC/DC's live shows. That honour went to his younger brother, Angus, dressed like a schoolboy and duck-walking across the stage like Chuck Berry.
But Malcolm gave the band their backbone. He wrote brutally efficient riffs and played them with concentrated ferocity, proving you don't need to rifle through 127 notes to be effective. And, while AC/DC rarely strayed from the template they set on Highway To Hell and Back in Black, those guitar lines inspired generations, from Metallica's James Hetfield to Guns N' Roses' Izzy Stradlin.
One of the reasons for Malcolm's songwriting economy was that he didn't much enjoy the process of making records. "Being in the studio is like being in prison," he said in 1988.
Yet he took great care over AC/DC's sound, stripping out unnecessary flourishes and, unusually, playing with his amp turned down so the microphone could pick out the details.
Still, it was concerts that got his blood racing. "There's nothing like playing on stage," he said. "If it's a good night, it's just like the first night. Same buzz. Same excitement."
That made his final tour with AC/DC all the more tragic. As his dementia progressed, the guitarist found himself unable to remember the riffs to songs like Hell's Bells and You Shook Me All Night Long, having to relearn them for every show.

A US warship has sustained minor damage after a collision with a Japanese tug off central Japan, the US Navy says.
The commercial tug lost propulsion and drifted into the guided-missile destroyer, the USS Benfold, during a towing exercise in Sagami Bay.
"No one was injured on either vessel," the US Navy says, adding that an investigation is under way.
This is the latest in a series of incidents involving US warships in recent months.
In a statement, the US Navy says the warship "sustained minimal damage, including scrapes on its side".
"Benfold remains at sea under her own power. The Japanese commercial tug is being towed by another vessel to a port in Yokosuka."
In August, 10 US sailors were killed when the USS John S McCain collided with an oil tanker east of Singapore.
In June, seven US sailors died in a collision between the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship in Japanese waters near the port city of Yokosuka.
In May, a guided-missile cruiser collided with a South Korean fishing vessel, while in January another cruiser ran aground near the fleet base in Yokosuka.
The US has recently announced a series of reforms aimed at increasing naval skills and alertness at sea.
Image copyright DigitalGlobe Image caption Satellite images appear to show evidence of a submarine-launched missile programme
North Korea is on "an aggressive schedule to build and deploy its first operational ballistic missile submarine", according to an analysis of new satellite images by the expert website 38 North.
The images represent a powerful reminder that, as well as developing inter-continental range ballistic missiles launched from land, North Korea has for several years been pursuing a programme to launch a long-range missile from a submarine.
It already has a prototype sub and a submersible launching barge, from which it has carried out a number of test firings. But the new images show that significant work is under way at the Sinpo shipyard on North Korea's eastern coast to expand its construction facilities, and there are hints that another missile-carrying submarine may be under construction.
The imagery shows two large circular objects that could be sections of a submarine's pressure hull. Size estimates suggest the objects could be for a follow on vessel to the existing prototype SINPO-class boat.
Satellite images show a continued movement throughout 2017 of parts and components into and out of yards adjacent to the shipyard's large construction halls. Gantry and tower cranes have been regularly moved, all suggesting a "prolonged and active ship-building programme", according to 38 North.
Image copyright DigitalGlobe Image caption 2
Work has also been under way at a missile test stand that is apparently used to replicate the ejection of a missile from a submarine's hull.
From satellite images alone it is difficult to assess how much progress North Korea's submarine-launched missile programme has made. But Mark Fitzpatrick, a veteran arms control expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the BBC that submarine-launched missiles would give North Korea a second-strike capability if it faced an attack intended to take out its nuclear forces.
Mr Fitzpatrick also noted that "up to now, North Korea has frequently surprised analysts and exceeded expectations in terms of the pace of its missile development".
Firing a missile from a submerged submarine poses very particular challenges. So far, the North Korea has only used a submersible testing barge, and its sea-borne missile programme remains far from operational.
But the programme is a measure of Pyongyang's strategic ambitions, and another indication that it is unlikely to give up its nuclear arsenal any time soon.

Spain's attorney general José Manuel Maza has died suddenly in Argentina, where he was attending a conference. He was 66.
Earlier on Saturday he had been reportedly taken to an intensive care unit with a kidney infection.
Last month, Mr Maza called for charges to be brought against Catalan leaders, following a banned independence referendum in the region.
Spain's political leaders have been paying tribute.
In a tweet (in Spanish), Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy expressed his "deepest condolences" to Mr Maza's family and friends.
Justice Minister Rafael Catalá described Mr Maza as an extraordinary lawyer and public servant.
Mr Maza was appointed Spain's attorney general in November 2016.
Key figure in Catalonia's crisis
By the BBC's James Reynolds in Barcelona
José Manuel Maza's sudden death has shocked the Spanish political establishment.
He'd been heavily involved in the constitutional crisis here in Catalonia.
Mr Maza had decided that the Catalan separatists' attempt to break away from Spain was a criminal matter.
This decision to prosecute found widespread support in Spain's conservative government.
Mr Maza's death may not change Spain's legal policy towards the deposed Catalan politicians.
Right now, the main target of the prosecution, deposed Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, remains in Belgium - from where he is contesting Spain's request to extradite him.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Sebastián Piñera (left) and Alejandro Guillier are seen as the main rivals in Sunday's poll
Chileans are due to vote in presidential elections to choose a successor to Michelle Bachelet.
Eight candidates are standing, with conservative billionaire Sebastián Piñera seen as favourite to return to the post he held from 2010-14.
Socialist contender Alejandro Guillier, a former journalist, is regarded as the most realistic challenger to Mr Piñera.
On Sunday, voters are also electing all 155 members of the lower house and half of the senate.
Mr Piñera, 67, has been leading in recent opinion polls. However, analysts say he may fail to get 50% of the votes needed to avoid a run-off in December.
In 2010, he became Chile's first conservative leader since the country's return to democracy, ending two decades of uninterrupted centre-left rule.
During the current presidential campaign Mr Piñera has managed to unite Chile's conservative wing, and enjoys backing of the business community.
He represents the right-wing Chile Vamos coalition.
His victory would represent another shift to the right in South America after the rise of conservative leaders in Argentina, Brazil and Peru.
Meanwhile, Mr Guillier, 64, is a candidate from Ms Bachelet's left-wing Nueva Mayoria coalition.
He has pledged to continue a series of liberal reforms launched by Ms Bachelet, who is unable to seek immediate re-election under Chile's constitution.

Riot police and army troops have been deployed in southern Sri Lanka following an outbreak of violence between Buddhists and Muslims, and a curfew has been imposed for the second night running.
Nineteen people were arrested when clashes erupted in Galle province, after a traffic accident.
Homes and businesses were attacked and several properties damaged.
Authorities say the sectarian violence has now been brought under control.
"Additional police battalions, the police Special Task Force, the anti-riot squad and the military were called in last night to bring the situation under control," Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said in a statement.
He also warned people not to stir up sectarian hatred on social media.
MP Manusha Nanyakkara told the BBC that 10 vehicles were destroyed, the majority of which were owned by Muslims, and 62 homes and businesses were attacked.
He said the 6pm-6am curfew was imposed as a security measure to prevent further violence.
Image caption A damaged motorbike is discarded in the street following the violence
Image caption Several properties in Galle province were vandalised
The outbreak of street violence between majority Sinhalese Buddhists and minority Muslims started after an incident involving a Muslim woman and a motorbike driven by a Buddhist man.
A police spokesman said people were arrested after "spreading false messages and rumours on social media" that contributed to the escalation in violence.
Similar clashes in a nearby area three years ago forced thousands of Muslims to flee their homes.

Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams has revealed he plans to stand down as leader of the party next year.
Mr Adams also said he will not stand for election to the Irish parliament (Dail) at the next election.
Speaking at the Sinn Féin ard fhéis (party conference) in Dublin, Mr Adams said it would be his last as leader.
"Leadership means knowing when it's time for change and that time is now," the 69-year-old, who has been party president since 1983, said.
Analysis: BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport
So the build-up was justified - to paraphrase one of Gerry Adams' most famous phrases, he is going away you know.
The precise date will depend on the party's ard comhairle or ruling executive which is expected to meet within the next fortnight - they will in turn call an extraordinary ard fheis where a new leader will be elected.
Sinn Féin may hope that Mr Adams' decision not to stand in the next Irish election will make any talks about a future coalition in Dublin more straightforward.
But the Fianna Fáil Leader Micheal Martin has repeated his view that Sinn Fein remains unacceptable as a partner in government.
Whatever the future brings, though, there's no doubt Gerry Adams' move marks an historic change as a leader who oversaw the republican movement's journey between violence and peace gives way to another politician who will pursue Irish unity through more conventional parliamentary politics.
Mr Adams, the TD (member of the Irish parliament) for County Louth, said he would be asking the party leadership to agree a date in 2018 for a special party conference to elect a new leader.
"I have always seen myself as a team player, as a team builder," he said.
"I have complete confidence in the leaders we elected this weekend and in the next generation of leaders."
Image copyright Getty/AFP Image caption Mr Adams is surrounded by party colleagues after his announcement
Mr Adams said the move was formulated along with party colleague Martin McGuinness before his death earlier this year.
It has already seen Michelle O'Neill, 40, take the role of Sinn Fein's leader at Stormont.
Earlier, delegates at the conference voted in favour of a motion to hold a special ard fhéis three months after the departure of the party president.
The motion will allow for a leadership contest once the vacancy arises.
Abortion vote
Delegates also voted to liberalise the party's policy on abortion.
Party members voted in favour of allowing abortions where a pregnancy poses a risk to a woman's health, including mental health.
Image caption The ard fhéis (party conference) has been taking place in Dublin
There will be a referendum on abortion law in the Republic of Ireland in May or June of next year.
Sinn Féin's previous position supported allowing terminations when a baby is expected to die in the womb or shortly after birth, and in cases of rape or incest.
Currently, the law in the Republic of Ireland only permits abortion when there is a real and substantial risk to a woman's life. In Northern Ireland, terminations are only legal when continuing with a pregnancy poses a serious or permanent risk to a woman's health.
Meanwhile, Sinn Féin's Stormont leader has called on the Irish government to appoint a minister with responsibility for advancing Irish unity.
Michelle O'Neill told the party conference that a parliamentary committee in the Republic of Ireland should also be formed to look at a united Ireland.

A rare India ink drawing of young reporter Tintin and his faithful dog Snowy has been sold for almost $500,000 (£380,000) at auction in Paris.
The picture from the 1939 comic album King Ottokar's Sceptre was among items by Hergé, the Belgian artist who created Tintin, to go under the hammer.
An original strip from the book The Shooting Star fetched $350,000.
But a copy of Tintin adventure Destination Moon, signed by US astronauts, failed to find a buyer.
Other items by Hergé on sale at the Paris auction included books, sketches and drawings.
Tintin is one of the most recognisable comic-book characters ever created.
Translated into 90 languages and selling in excess of 200m copies, the cartoons remain popular to this day.
Last year a comic strip from the Tintin book Explorers on the Moon sold for a record $1.64m in Paris.
The same year, a rare drawing of Tintin in Shanghai from the book The Blue Lotus sold for $1.2m at auction in Hong Kong.

The female warrior Yaa is a "badass" according to photographer Heather Agyepong who has re-imagined the leader for images which fall from the ceiling of the Tate Modern in her latest show. They depict strength, but also reveal how the stereotype of the "strong, black woman" led to her own depression.
Agyepong was born and raised in London, the daughter of immigrant parents from the Ashanti tribe in Ghana. Yaa is a celebrated Ghanaian warrior from the same tribe - they may or may not be related.
"My Yaa is a badass, and powerful," Agyepong says. "She goes into spaces and fills them and sometimes I feel like that and sometimes I don't."
As a black, female, artist in the UK, Agyepong admits she doesn't always feel totally at home or equal in galleries or museums and has taken a more personal take on black life to take attention away from "black trauma".
She says people have become used to seeing "slavery, or films about women in pain" and rather than "dwell on this painful situation" she wants her work to reinvigorate and "reclaim" these cultural spaces and help black people feel "empowered".
Image copyright Heather Agyepong/Tate Exchange
Her latest project sees the 27-year-old recreate photographs and pose as Yaa.
The warrior, Yaa Asantewaa, led the Ashanti rebellion known as the War of the Golden Stool in 1900.
It was a fight against British colonialism after the British governor demanded the tribe hand over the gold stool - their symbol of sovereignty.
Agyepong says Yaa is a "symbol of pride, tenacity and defiance" in Ghana, but in the London museum she says she has used it, not to "indulge in the spectacle of black pain" but to show fighting spirit and confidence.
The photographer says the project was borne out of research by Cambridge University which found the mental health challenges of black people of African descent were exacerbated when they were not around other black African people.
Agyepong can identify with that having been brought up as part of a black minority in the UK.
She says she has fought against a sense of isolation at times when she has gone into galleries and found very little artwork or staff members that reflect her cultural heritage.
"I thought what does that mean about black creatives in spaces, where they don't see themselves? Are there any mental health implications?"
The work, But We Are Still Here, is part of Tate Exchange, a programme of events which considers how society's perceptions impact the production of culture.
Agyepong has spent the last nine months researching her warrior and musing on what Yaa might do if, like her, she was living in contemporary Britain - "If I was Yaa on the bus when this person said this, what would I do?"
Image copyright Heather Agyepong/Tate Exchange
It harks back to a youth, confused with a British-Ghanaian identity and the uncertainty over who she was or meant to be and how she should act.
Her work, she says, reflects her own personal experiences.
"When people talk about Black British female artists it's always about 'all black women' and I'm just trying to say this is about me and if you relate, 'cool'."
She says for years there has been a "silent assumption" that all black women must be strong and this made her believe there was no place for vulnerability, but she now recognises that as a survival strategy.
"My mum came here as an immigrant. She was treated differently and she's black so she was like 'I have to be on survival mode, I can't cry'. I think we're forced to be resilient and then we find difficulties when we're vulnerable."
The "culture clashes" which was one of the many factors which led her to experience depression as a teenager, something she didn't even talk about with her friends because she thought she had to show she was strong and nothing should get to her, even racism.
"Somebody would say something racist and we'd laugh and say 'idiot'," she says. Only later would it dawn on them they had accepted racial prejudice.
It was during a deep-set depression, between the ages of 16 and 22, that she started to use a camera to create artwork.
She took "really bad pictures" of items in her life which helped boost her mental health and says photography has remained a positive outlet even in difficult times.
Her last project, Too Many Blackamoors, may have won plaudits, but it also impacted on her mental health.
The term "Blackamoor" related to black Africans and was referenced in a royal letter sent from Queen Elizabeth to the Lord Mayor of London in 1596 stating there were "too many" and should be expelled.
Agyepong's project told the later story of Sarah Forbes Bonetta who's family was killed in a slave raid in Nigeria in the 1840s when she was just four-years-old.
The girl was gifted to Queen Victoria who adopted her as a goddaughter, provided an education and a place to live in Windsor Castle.
But the photographic work, which Agyepong re-imagined, looked beyond this apparent "happy ending" and at how Sarah may have actually felt about being taken away to live a very different life.
Image copyright Heather Agyepong/Autograph ABP
"It was about people experiencing racism in European countries which happened to me the year before [in 2015]," Agyepong says.
"When it was first on the walls I cried because no one knows what I was thinking about during those images. They were saying 'this is great' and I was thinking 'you don't understand'."
She says there are now positive moves in how her community discusses mental health, partly thanks to social media and she hopes Yaa may add to this.
"My friendship groups never used to speak about it five years ago and now we talk about it quite regularly, I can actually feel a shift."
Even though Agyepong's work touches upon mental health, her overall aim is inclusivity.
"We're all in this together and my project is to say 'I see you, I feel the same, I've been through the same thing, it's cool'."
Heather Agyepong's work But We Are Still Here will be on display at the Tate Modern as part of Tate Exchange until 26 November.

The discovery of human remains near a small town in northern France last year sparked a search that quickly spread half-way across the globe. The two men, it turned out, were Indian soldiers who died on French battlefields more than 100 ago during World War One.
They were finally laid to rest this month, in a ceremony especially poignant for the Indian diaspora in France.
A crowd gathers quietly at a small cemetery in Laventie. Many of them are of Indian origin and have travelled from across France, undeterred by the cold weather and distance - both physical and from events that took place so many years ago.
A Hindu priest chants prayers in front of two flag-draped coffins, as Indian and French military personnel stand in respect.
For Indians who now call France home coming here wasn't just about honouring those who gave their lives in war. It is about their own place in history.
"This is very important for the Indian diaspora, because it gives us a link to history," says Ranjit Singh, a proud member of the French-Sikh community.
"It reminds us that a century ago - some soldiers came here [from India]. It isn't just something written in the books. We can feel it, we can see it today."

Some 1.3 million Indian soldiers served in the World War One and more than 70,000 died in places like northern France - where decisive battles were fought.
A few kilometres away from Laventie, in Neuve Chapelle, a memorial lists the names of many Indian soldiers who died fighting for the British Empire.
Nalinee Goojha, who lives in Paris, told me she was thinking of the soldiers' mothers, "whose children came to fight a war here in France, where I now live, and they never saw their children again".
She adds: "I live in France and these people fought for us. We are here, in France, which is a free country, because of them."
Remarkably, the soldiers were identified by badges found on their bodies. After a century buried in the French mud, the number "39" was still legible when the bodies were found.
That stands for the 39th Royal Garhwal Rifles - an infantry regiment raised during the time of the British Raj. Its history goes back to 1854.
Image caption A badge found with the remains
The regiment was one of few in the Indian army to have two battalions, and both were sent to Europe with the Garhwal Brigade - part of the 7th (Meerut) Division - in the early part of the World War One where they fought on the Western Front.
Later they took part in the Mesopotamia campaign in the Middle East.
The Garhwal Rifles - as they are now called - were incorporated into the Indian army after independence and the regiment was contacted by the French authorities after the remains were found and their origins identified.
Image caption Ranjit Singh travelled from Paris to attend the ceremony
Brig Indrajit Chatterjee, Commandant of the Garhwal Rifles Regimental Centre, travelled from India for the ceremony. Two bagpipers from the regiment also played.
The fallen soldiers were being cremated and laid to rest with full honours, Brigadier Chatterjee said.
The Indian soldiers saw some of their fiercest fighting in the battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915. The troops, both Indian and British, were commanded by Sir Douglas Haig.
Rifleman Gabbar Singh Negi won the Victoria Cross and his grandson, who is now a serving Indian Army officer, was present at the ceremony in Laventie.
Laventie Military Cemetery and other graves in the area are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
"What we try to do always is to reunite the men that are found today with the men they fought alongside 100 years ago. In this case, more than 100 years ago," says Liz Sweet from the commission.
"In the cemetery where they were buried today, there was a sizable pocket of Indian men commemorated and they were placed alongside those men."
Before leaving France, the Indian army representatives filled two urns with soil from the area - a piece of the ground on which so many of their regiment fought and died.

After the US decision to quit the Paris climate agreement, the European Union set its sights on becoming a global leader in curbing fossil fuel emissions.
But some of its eastern neighbours that seek to join the bloc have severe levels of air pollution. The BBC's Environment Correspondent Navin Khadka visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, where a heavy reliance on the coal industry has led to high levels of pollution.
Many people are switching back to coal as a cheaper alternative to imported gas from Russia.
But the high level of air pollution in the Balkan state has become a cause for alarm for the locals.

Image caption Fruit for sale in a market-place - but few can afford to buy it
How do you explain a famine in a country where there's food?
A couple of years ago I was in Ethiopia, reporting on the threat of famine, in the same place where BBC correspondent Michael Buerk covered the "biblical" famine in 1985.
Those famines, or so-called "parched-earth" famines, sort of make sense. If food doesn't grow because, say the rains have failed, then people starve.
I was in Kenya in 2011, covering a parched-earth famine there too. Catastrophe was compounded by war in both cases - conflict with separatist guerrillas in 1980s Ethiopia and with al-Shabab Islamists more recently in Kenya - but the bottom line was food wasn't growing.
This is different. Welcome to Yemen in 2017. The UN estimates seven million people are facing famine in the Arab world's poorest nation - yet there's no parched earth.
In the frontline city of Taiz, under siege from Houthi rebels for two-and-a-half years, a stroll around one of the local markets reveals abundance. Huge pomegranates and oranges, fresh garlic, bananas, courgettes and tangerines.
There are supermarkets full of produce too - fresh meat, eggs, steaks and ribs. So how on earth can this country be starving? It makes no sense.
Soaring prices
I was shown around one of the markets in Taiz by a man I'd met the day before. Sami Abdul Hadi, 55, saw our team filming outside one hospital.
He introduced himself to us and said we had to make sure our report included the real crime about the conflict in Yemen: people are starving, he said, yet there's plenty of food to go round. So we agreed to meet the next day.
"Look at these fruits," Sami told me, gesturing to a particularly healthy looking pile of oranges.
"Before the war, they were 300 Yemeni rials ($1.2; £0.90), now they're 600. No-one can afford the food here," he said, with a sigh of resignation and a shake of his head.
Image caption Taiz, Yemen's second city, has been besieged by rebels since 2015
Sami himself couldn't afford the food on display in front of him. A former insurance salesman, he'd been out of work since 2009 and relied on handouts from the World Food Programme.
Finding decent paying jobs, any job in Yemen, is pretty near impossible, in the middle of the war.
Under blockade
As I was talking to Sami, a group of people began to cluster around us.
A man in his 80s said he couldn't get the medicine he needed for his diabetes. Another man lamented the shortage of petrol and fuel. While one man said he hadn't been paid for weeks because of the war.

Yemen is cursed by man. Its tragedy isn't a failure in nature, but a failure of politics. It's experiencing a political famine.
Before the war 90% of Yemen's food was imported anyway. The prosperity of the nation, and its people, depended on fully functioning seaports, an uncluttered road network and open airspace.

The current conflict means these three things are under strain. Saudi Arabia, which is leading a coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen, can close the ports at will, making it difficult for food and aid shipments - upon which 21 million people now rely - to get into the country.
That's exactly what the kingdom did on 4 November, after rebels here fired a rocket, at Riyadh International Airport, across the border.
The aid agencies now fear that unless all the ports fully reopen soon, warehouse stocks will run out in the next few months.
Manmade
Yemen's road network is a mess. Some highways and bridges have been destroyed in the war, and convoys of food have to run the gauntlet of rebels, who've been known to hold up lorries, and only send them on to areas sympathetic to their cause.
Lorry drivers also have to worry about routes, that cross-cross territory controlled by al-Qaeda.
All this is what makes Yemen's "famine" manmade and political.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Across Yemen three million people have had to flee their homes
Sami Abdul Hadi, like millions of Yemenis, just cannot quite understand how he got into this mess.
He was educated at the University of Cairo. He has a degree in political science and he speaks good English. Living off handouts from the UN isn't what he expected in his life.
But then, how do you plan for a war that's killed or wounded more than 12,000 people, displaced more than three million, and beggared a nation?
Image caption Christa Nolte as a baby with her mother and her brother - she still has the teddy bear
Between 1944 and 1947, an estimated 12 million ethnic Germans fled or were expelled from their homes. Overshadowed by the crimes of the Nazis, their stories have often received little international attention. But these days, as Bethany Bell reports from Germany, the new arrivals from Syria have awakened old memories about what it means to flee.
Christa Nolte carefully lifted a little book out of a box of family papers.
"This is what my grandmother, Anna, took with her when we fled," she told me. "It was important for her to save it."
It was a pocket-sized Lutheran hymnal, the Silesian Church's Songbook.
Christa was a war baby, born in April 1943. Her family came from the town of Goldberg in Silesia, which back then was part of Germany. Today it's in Poland.
"We left in early 1945, my mother, my grandmother, my brother and me," Christa said. "The Red Army was coming. It was very cold."
The family took very little with them. Just a few pieces of cutlery, her brother's teddy bear and a feather duvet, which her mother, Margarethe, stuffed into her pram. Christa, not quite two years old, sat on the top.
"My mother originally wanted to get to her brother in Berlin," Christa told me.
"But our train was stopped just outside Dresden because the Allied aerial firebombing of the city had just begun."
I had met Christa in Saxony, in eastern Germany. She had just come from Berlin, where she had taken part in a church choir festival, along with a group from Coventry, another city blitzed during World War Two. Quiet and contained, she told me her story matter-of-factly, without drama.
Outside Dresden, the family set off on foot, through the snow and extreme cold. They eventually reached a camp a little way off south-east, in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. Christa got very sick, with measles and then pneumonia. The child in the next bed died. She remembers people crying and air raid sirens - sounds that still haunt her.

At the end of the war, the family managed to get back to Goldberg - partly on foot, partly by train. At one point, they were surrounded by Russian soldiers, one of whom accosted her mother, Margarethe. She was terrified he meant to rape her, but instead he gave her a piece of ham.
When they got back home, everything had changed. Polish families from eastern regions, which had been transferred to the Soviet Union, had been moved into Goldberg and into their family home.
At the Potsdam conference in the summer of 1945, the Allies agreed that the German territories east of the Oder-Neisse rivers - including Goldberg - should be given to Poland.
So in 1946, Christa and her family left again - to become part of a mass exodus west. "We were on a train for nine days. We didn't know where we were going. We all had lice and fleas," Christa remembered.
She turned to me, with a rueful smile. "When we eventually got to the Rhineland, west of Duesseldorf, the farmers we were sent to live with didn't want us either. The first thing they asked us was: 'Are you Catholic or Protestant?' They were Catholic. We were Protestants. It was our biggest mistake."

Stories like Christa's are common. During my short stay in Saxony, I met a number of people who had come from Silesia or East Prussia as children. I also discovered that the old manor house where I was staying had been used as a refugee camp for Germans from the east well into the 1950s.
For many years, the fate of the ethnic Germans has been an uncomfortable topic - always overshadowed by Nazi atrocities, and repeatedly exploited by far-right groups.
"There are books about it, and we talk about it among ourselves," Christa told me. "I don't feel so badly affected. Children manage everywhere and in the end things didn't go so badly for me in the West - although the local children called us names for years."
But seeing Syrian refugees arrive in Germany today makes her think.
"Their experience is like ours - like that of our mothers and grandmothers - the rapes, sleeping rough, trying to keep your children safe."
"You mention rape," I said. "Did that happen to your mother?"
"She never spoke about it," Christa said. "Never."

It was only in 1990, after the fall of Communism, that Christa and her mother were able to visit their old home again - Goldberg, now known by the Polish name Zlotorja.
Christa says Margarethe had made peace with the fact that Polish families were now settled there. "It would be a huge injustice if they had to move," she'd said. "Where would they go?"
A week after our conversation, I received an email from Christa, who had gone on to visit Germany's Baltic coast near Rostock. It contained the photo of a refugee cookery book, recently put together by a local community there. The recipes were from Silesia, East Prussia, Afghanistan and Syria.

Jesus is standing at the altar in a sparkly gold dress and heels.
Her wavy brown hair falls mid-way down her back. She breaks bread and passes it around the congregation in the pews, some of whom are sipping communion wine too.
Confused? Actress Renata Carvalho is playing the role of Jesus, a transgender Christ who is telling Bible stories with a modern take.
The show - The Gospel According to Jesus, Queen of Heaven - is a monologue written by Scottish playwright Jo Clifford.
In Brazil it is playing to packed audiences and making headlines.
One performance in Sao Paulo state was cancelled because a judge imposed an emergency injunction. It was subsequently lifted.
Other groups tried to shut it down, without success, and the cast has faced online abuse too.
Transphobia
"We were attacked by evangelical churches mostly," says the play's director, Natalia Mallo.
"With Jesus embodied in a trans woman, it addresses all the oppression and violence suffered by this population."
Ms Mallo says that Brazil is notoriously transphobic. According to Rede Trans, which tracks violence against transgender people, more than 170 transgender people have been killed so far this year.

Ms Mallo recently held a performance in an Anglican church in downtown Sao Paulo, a congregation that has been supportive of the work.
She also invited religious leaders from the city to watch the play and talk about it afterwards.
"We became the focus of a discussion about censorship and about the limits of art," says Ms Mallo.
"We thought it would be a nice way of responding by creating an event that shows that not all Christians are against what we are doing."
Censorship
The play is not alone in facing criticism from more conservative quarters.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Artists have taken to the streets to defend freedom of expression against protests by evangelical Christians
Santander Cultural, a cultural centre sponsored by Santander Bank in the city of Porto Alegre, put on an exhibition called Queer Museum in August.
But in September they ended it early after right-wing protestors said the works promoted bestiality and paedophilia.
As well as evangelical leaders, the Free Brazil Movement (MBL) played a part in the protests.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Free Brazil Movement gained strength during protests against former president Dilma Rousseff
The group describes itself as liberal and in support of free-market ideals. It grew out of protests demanding the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff and is gaining momentum.
Artists have criticised MBL for what they say is censorship.
Freedoms curtailed?
But one of its members, Arthur Moledo do Val, who has a popular YouTube Channel called MamaiFalei, disagrees.
"A boycott is an exercise in liberal citizenship because laws aren't used to censure another person," he says.
"We are against censorship, we support a boycott against an exhibition that society didn't see as healthy for children."
He does not agree that closing down the exhibition was an attack on freedom of expression.
"We believe in freedom of expression, not only for those people who are in favour of this kind of exhibition, but also for the people who are against it, like me," he says.
"If we as a society are against that kind of exhibition, why can't we be free to ask an institution to voluntarily close it? That too is freedom of expression is it not?"
Age-restricted
There have also been protests at the Modern Art Museum in Sao Paulo after a child was encouraged to touch a naked man in a piece of performance art.
In light of these protests, the curators at the Sao Paulo Museum of Art, one of the most influential museums in the country, are being extra careful with their new exhibition, Histories of Sexuality.
Image caption The Sao Paulo Museum of Art is hosting an exhibition called Histories of Sexuality
Some of the works in this exhibition already courted controversy in the Queer Museum.
So for the first time ever, after consulting lawyers, the gallery initially put an 18-and-over age restriction on visitors, something more commonly seen at music shows, plays and public presentations. Last week, they relaxed the rule to allow minors to attend the exhibition if they are accompanied by an adult.
"We've been planning this for over two years so it's not that we decided to do this exhibition because it's become such a polemic issue," says Adriano Pedrosa, the museum's artistic director.
"It's good timing because the exhibition becomes really more relevant for this discussion. We were also fortunate not to be the very first ones so we had time to prepare ourselves, or to try to prepare ourselves."
Pushing the boundaries
The museum's view is that it is better to be safe than sorry. However, censorship expert Cristina Costa says that while every country has its taboos, art is meant to challenge conventions.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Artists such as Felipe Vasconcelos, performing here with colourful balloons, are vigorously opposed to censorship
"The problem is that freedom of expression, as it is understood today, is the freedom of those who think like me, not the idea that pluralism exists," says Ms Costa, who is the head of the Communication, Freedom of Expression and Censorship Observatory at the University of Sao Paulo.
"We had a century of authoritarianism, fascism, Nazism, Stalinism and other isms. We're having a hard time dealing with diversity," she says.
Divided politics
Theatre director Natalia Mallo believes the protests are political.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The closure of some of the exhibitions has triggered anti-censorship rallies
"This is not meant to protect the family or children from naked people or from art that is inappropriate, this is about elections and gathering people around a narrative that this is bad," she says.
"It's a way of creating consensus around things that are controversial and where people choose sides."
At the end of her play, there is a round of applause and the audience starts chanting "Out with President Temer".
For many, what is happening in Brazil's creative spaces is a reflection of the politics here.
And the divide between left and right is set to become even more polarised ahead of general elections, due to take place next year.
Image copyright RAPID ACTION BATTALION Image caption One of the pirate groups after they surrendered to the Rapid Action Battalion
Home of the Bengal tiger, the Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest. It has also been a safe haven for nearly a dozen pirate gangs known for extortion and tiger poaching. Faced with deteriorating law and order and a steady decline in the number of tigers, last year the government offered an amnesty to the gangs. Has the plan worked? Masud Khan from BBC Bengali reports.
This little corner of Bagerhat town in south-western Bangladesh is no different to other sleepy towns. Set in lush green vegetation, sparsely populated, life in Bagerhat is quiet. This tranquillity is sometimes punctuated by the whining of motorcycle engines from Mostafa Sheikh's bike repair shop.
Neighbours know Mr Sheikh as a quiet little man, who keeps himself to himself. But their provincial zen may shatter should they learn that Mr Sheikh is actually the leader of the most notorious pirate gang - the infamous Master Bahini (Master Group) - which once controlled the entire southern coastline of Bangladesh.
Mr Sheikh has opted for the quiet life after surrendering to the police under a unique one-time amnesty programme offered by the government in 2016.
"My life is a bonus," he says. "One day, I was to die between the claws of a tiger, or by the fangs of a poisonous snake, or in a police shootout."
Every evening, after he shutters down his bike garage, he returns home to his wife and a daughter. "Now, I feel safe and sleep peacefully," he says.
The Master Bahini, with about 45 members, was the largest of the pirate gangs operating in the Sundarbans forest. These gangs used to extort protection money from honey collectors, crab farmers, bird catchers and illegal loggers.
They also used to launch attacks on hundreds of fishing trawlers operating in the Bay of Bengal, seizing expensive nets and other gear, and kidnapping fishermen for ransom.
'Mortal danger'
Image caption Mostafa Sheikh now runs a bike repair shop
None of the former pirates admitted to being involved in tiger poaching, but they were happy to describe how the process worked.
They said traders would obtain commissions from overseas buyers, and then contact one or more of the gangs, who either provided them with protection or who did the job themselves.
Mohammad Saiful Islam of the Forest Department said that 19 tigers were killed between 2003 and 2014, 10 of them by poachers.
There are believed to be around 180 Bengal Tigers in the Sundarbans, across both Indian and Bangladeshi territories.
So 10 tigers killed in Bangladeshi territory accounts for around 5% of the total tiger population across the vast area.
Mostafa Sheikh's gang had yearly earnings of about 60 million Bangladeshi Taka ($732,000) mainly from extortion, looting, and kidnapping; a lot of money for a Bangladeshi with no formal education.
Despite a steady inflow of cash, the pirates grew weary of running from the law.
"Life in jungle had no real value. You are always alert, always on the lookout for animals, police or rival pirate groups. All of them posed mortal dangers," says Arif Billal, a former member of the gang.
So, when Mr Sheikh decided to surrender, other members followed.
"The change of heart did not happen suddenly," says Moshin Ul Hakim, a local journalist who was involved in brokering the deal between the gangs and security forces.
He says the gangs had been under increasing pressure in recent years from a police unit known as the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and the Coast Guard, following an anti-piracy drive by the government in 2011.
According to the RAB, more than 100 pirates had been killed in clashes with the security forces.
Image caption TV journalist Mohsin Ul Hakim (in blue shirt), speaking to some of the pirates he helped to surrender
"The prospect of an untimely death really forced the pirates to reconsider their position. So, they chose to live," says Mr Hakim.
Vacuum?
On 31 May 2016 the first group, led by Mr Sheikh, surrendered to the RAB.
The other gangs saw Mostafa and his members being returned to their families, with some cash and promises of rehabilitation, and were persuaded to follow suit. In about a year, a dozen pirate groups, consisting of around 150 members, went back to their homes.
Once the pirates surrendered, they were produced before court. Most were bailed, but those accused of major offences such as murder or rape were denied bail and detained. The BBC understands that the government is considering, as part of the promise it made to the pirates, whether to advise the attorney general to "soften up" prosecution for smaller offences. But whether this is permitted under the law is not clear.
Those who have agreed to the deal have so far received cash hand-outs from the government. With this they are setting up small businesses, such as shops, or buying auto rickshaws, to earn a living.
But it is still unclear what future the government envisages as far as the full rehabilitation is concerned. The BBC understands that the government has even consider sending some of them abroad to protect them from any possible retribution attacks.
At the moment what the government is saying is: you stop piracy now, come back to your family and friends and we'll take care of you.
Image copyright Mohsin Ul Hakim Image caption A pirate gang operating at night
Mohammad Saiful Islam, the forest official from Bagerhat, says he believes the amnesty will have a "significant impact" on the tiger population.
Since the surrender, there have been no reports of poaching, he says.
But given how lucrative the trade is, there is no guarantee this will last.
Mr Islam says that the gangs have been operating under criminal "godfathers", who run an elaborate network.
This presents a major challenge for the law enforcing agencies.
"At the moment, there are no pirates in the forest. That means nobody is forcing money out of the wood collectors, crab farmers, honey collectors or kidnapping the fishing folks," says Mohsin Ul Hakim.
"[But] if you fail to take care of the godfathers who live in the background, the current vacuum will be quickly filled in by new generation of aspiring pirates.
"The money at stake is too big to ignore. And that would be a bad news for all - including the Bengal tigers."
Image copyright Reuters/EPA Image caption Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (L) and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
Saudi Arabia and Iran are at loggerheads. They have long been rivals, but it's all recently got a lot more tense. Here's why.
How come Saudi Arabia and Iran don't get along?
Saudi Arabia and Iran - two powerful neighbours - are locked in a fierce struggle for regional dominance.
The decades-old feud between them is exacerbated by religious differences. They each follow one of the two main sects in Islam - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power.
This religious schism is reflected in the wider map of the Middle East, where other countries have Sunni or Shia majorities, some of whom look towards Iran or Saudi Arabia for support or guidance.
Historically Saudi Arabia, a monarchy and home to the birthplace of Islam, saw itself as the leader of the Muslim world. However this was challenged in 1979 by the Islamic revolution in Iran which created a new type of state in the region - a kind of theocracy - that had an explicit goal of exporting this model beyond its own borders.
In the past 15 years in particular, the differences between Saudi Arabia and Iran have been sharpened by a series of events.
The 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq overthrew Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Arab who had been a major Iranian adversary. This removed a crucial military counter-weight to Iranian influence in Iraq, which has been rising since then.
Fast-forward to 2011 and uprisings across the Arab world caused political instability throughout the region. Iran and Saudi Arabia exploited these upheavals to expand their influence, notably in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, further heightening mutual suspicions.
Iran's critics say it is intent on establishing itself or its proxies across the region, and achieve control of a land corridor stretching from Iran to the Mediterranean.
How have things suddenly got worse?
The strategic rivalry is heating up because Iran is in many ways winning the regional struggle.
In Syria, Iranian (and Russian) support for President Bashar al-Assad has largely routed rebel group groups backed by Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia is trying desperately to contain rising Iranian influence and the militaristic adventurism of the kingdom's young and impulsive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - the country's de facto ruler - is exacerbating regional tensions.

He is waging a war against rebels in Saudi Arabia's southern neighbour, Yemen, in part to stem perceived Iranian influence there, but after nearly three years this is proving a costly gamble.
Meanwhile in Lebanon, many observers believe the Saudis put pressure on the prime minister to resign in order to destabilise a country where Iran's ally, Shia militia group Hezbollah, leads a politically powerful bloc and controls a huge, heavily armed fighting force.
There are also external forces at play. Saudi Arabia has been emboldened by support from the Trump administration while Israel, which sees Iran as a mortal threat, is in a sense "backing" the Saudi effort to contain Iran.

The Jewish state is fearful of the encroachment of pro-Iranian fighters in Syria ever closer to its border.
Israel and Saudi Arabia were the two countries most resolutely opposed to the 2015 international agreement limiting Iran's nuclear programme, insisting that it did not go far enough to roll back any chance of Iran obtaining the bomb.
Who are their regional allies?
Broadly speaking the strategic map of the Middle East reflects the Shia-Sunni divide.
In the pro-Saudi camp are the other major Sunni actors in the Gulf - the UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain, as well as Egypt and Jordan.
In the Iranian camp is Syria's government, which has been strongly backed by Iran, and where pro-Iranian Shia militia groups, including the Lebanon-based Hezbollah, have played a prominent role in fighting predominantly Sunni rebel groups.
The Shia-dominated Iraqi government is also a close ally of Iran, though paradoxically it also retains a close relationship with Washington on whom it has depended for help in the struggle against so-called Islamic State.
How is the Saudi-Iranian rivalry being played out?
This is in many ways a regional equivalent of the Cold War, which pitted the US against the Soviet Union in a tense military standoff for many years.
Iran and Saudi Arabia are not directly fighting but they are engaged in a variety of proxy wars around the region.
Syria is an obvious example while in Yemen Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of supplying ballistic missiles fired at Saudi territory by the Shia Houthi rebel movement - an incident which heightened the war of words between the two countries.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Yemen is one of a number of battlegrounds fuelling Iranian-Saudi tensions
But having become bogged down in Yemen and essentially defeated in Syria, Saudi Arabia seems to have its eye on Lebanon as the next proxy battlefield.
Lebanon risks being tipped into Syria-like chaos but few analysts see Saudi interests prevailing there.
Conflict in Lebanon could so easily draw in Israel in opposition to Hezbollah and this could lead to a third Israel-Lebanon war far more devastating than any of the previous encounters.
Some cynics wonder if the Saudi crown prince's game plan is to trigger a war between Israel and Hezbollah and deliver a heavy blow to the group this way!
Are we heading towards a direct war between Saudi Arabia and Iran?
So far Tehran and Riyadh have fought via proxies. Neither is really geared up for a direct war with the other but one successful rocket attack on the Saudi capital from Yemen could upset the apple cart.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Will Saudi Arabia go to war with Iran?
One obvious area where they could come into direct conflict is in the waters of the Gulf, where they face each other across a maritime border.
But here too fighting could risk a much broader conflict. For the US and other Western powers, freedom of navigation in the Gulf is essential and any conflict that sought to block the waterway - vital for international shipping and oil transportation - could easily draw in US naval and air forces.
For a long time the US and its allies have seen Iran as a destabilising force in the Middle East. The Saudi leadership increasingly sees Iran as an existential threat and the crown prince seems willing to take whatever action he sees necessary, wherever he deems it necessary, to confront Tehran's rising influence.
The danger is that Saudi Arabia's new activism is fast making it a further source of volatility in the region.

Speculation is swirling that the Murdoch family is open to breaking up its entertainment business.
Shares in 21st Century Fox gained more than 6% on Friday, after several sources reported interest from Comcast, Sony and Verizon.
Last week the company, which is led by the family of Rupert Murdoch, was said to have held talks with Disney.
The talk is that the Murdochs might be prepared to part with the movie studios along with some other parts of the business - an abrupt shift in strategy after years of empire building.
21st Century Fox has not directly addressed the speculation and a spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
And analysts said it isn't clear how seriously to take the idea of a sale.
But the talk seems to have whetted rivals' appetites for a piece of Fox if it really is available.
"It's not a surprise why anyone would want the assets," "said Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research. "It's a surprise Fox would be listening."
He added: "Nobody would ever have thought that the Murdochs were interested in downsizing."
What would 21st Century Fox sell?
From his start as a newspaper owner in Australia, Mr Murdoch, 86, has built a media empire that spans Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas.
Image caption How 21st Century Fox fits into the Murdoch empire
His 21st Century Fox business is known for its flagship Fox News channel, as well as National Geographic, Asia-based Star TV, and a range of sports channels and local news stations.
It's also known for expanding not shrinking.
Rupert Murdoch has always "been the predator. He's never been the prey so to speak," said Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster in London.
The Wall Street Journal - in which the Murdoch family also has a large voting stake - reported that Fox is discussing its movie studio, cable networks and international businesses, including Europe-based broadcaster Sky.
That would leave the firm more narrowly focused on sports and news.
Those areas have been sources of growth in recent years, unlike its film entertainment unit, where revenue has declined.
"It is conceivable that [Rupert Murdoch] is thinking about retrenching into the areas that he feels most comfortable with, which have been most profitable for him, which are news and sport," Mr Barnett said.
Why would he sell?
Last year, Fox announced a deal to take full control of Sky, in which it already has a 39% stake. But the merger has been delayed, pending approval by UK authorities.
It's a sign of broader political headwinds for the firm, which has also been buffeted by a sexual harassment scandal in the US.

The Murdochs had to abandon a previous bid for Sky after the phone-hacking scandal in the UK.
Media analyst Claire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis, said the current speculation suggests that Fox wants to explore other possibilities should that deal fall through again.
"I think this is really Plan B," she said.
It could also signal discord within the family over the direction of the business, she added.
Are there broader market reasons?
The reports come amid upheaval in the media industry, as viewers turn increasingly towards online video, and away from subscriptions for pay-TV.
Analysts say changing consumer habits have prompted media and entertainment executives to explore more consolidation of content creation and distribution functions.
"The big success stories of the future are going to be those that can read across content and distribution," said Mr Barnett.

On a conference call with analysts earlier this month, James and Lachlan Murdoch dismissed the idea that the firm, which brought in nearly $29bn (£21.5bn) in revenue in its most recent financial year, is not big enough to compete.
But they also pointed out that the company has streamlined operations in recent years. Among other changes, the family has sold some companies and separated its newspapers into a different company.
The comments suggested the family is "not ruling out" a potential split, said Mr Wieser.
Or is this not about a sale at all?
It could all be part of a longer game plan, said Ian Whittaker, at London based investment analysts Liberum.
Three years ago, Fox tried to acquire Time Warner but was rebuffed.
Now that deal could be in the firm's sights again, as a pending merger between AT&T and Time Warner faces questions from US competition authorities.
If the Time Warner-AT&T tie-up falls apart, Fox could use sale of some assets to fund a bid for Time Warner, Mr Whittaker said. If it goes through, then he won't need the money, he added.
But any Fox deal - for Time Warner or with the other potential suitors - would face close regulatory scrutiny.
"It's quite a challenge," said Ms Enders. "It's not something that's going to happen in a tearing hurry."
At the next table in the cafe where I was working this morning, a young woman spent a whole hour talking excitedly to her older companion about herself, her hopes and aspirations for her job, her romantic relationship and her home. It was hard to avoid the impression that she thought herself the centre of the Universe, her dreams eminently fascinating and important.
Is this simply what young people or "millennials" (people born after 1980) are like these days? Fuelled by the endless opportunity for self-promotion and self-reflection on social media, combined with a wider culture that's arguably placed greater emphasis on the importance of self-esteem than learning, have young people's personalities changed from earlier generations to become more narcissistic and selfish?
Psychologists are divided. Some say the evidence that the young have become "Generation Me" is overwhelming, yet others counter just as strongly that this simply isn't true. Meanwhile, more encouraging evidence is emerging to show positive trends in how our personalities seem to be changing over time, similar to the way that intelligence has increased over the generations.
The most vocal proponent of the view that young people today are more narcissistic and self-centred than in previous generations is psychologist Jean Twenge at San Diego State University, California, who has been studying the shift for more than 15 years.
Twenge believes that the rise in narcissism has its roots in cultural changes, especially the increased focus on individualism through the last few decades. For example, with parents, and society as a whole, today arguably placing greater value on young people's individual achievement over their civic duty.
Another possible theory is that it's down to what's been dubbed the "self-esteem movement" - the idea that many of society's problems, from drug addiction to violence, can be traced to people having low self-esteem. Alas, countless studies have shown this simply isn't true; in fact, myth 33 in the book 50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology is "Low self-esteem is a major cause of psychological problems". Nevertheless, thanks to this movement, especially through the 1980s and 1990s, efforts were made to protect young people from negative feedback, such as poor grades, for fear it may damage their self-esteem. At the same time, self-love and feelings of being "special" were nurtured.
Writing in New York magazine recently, Jesse Singal describes how the self-esteem movement especially took hold in American schools, which adopted exercises like Koosh ball: "A kid tosses the ball to another kid and compliments them — I like your shirt. Then they toss the ball to someone else and compliment them — You're good at soccer. The good feelings travel with the Koosh ball across the room, back and forth and back and forth."
Given these cultural trends, it certainly seems plausible that today's youth might have learned to see themselves as gifted and crave admiration.
Much of Jean Twenge's case is based on the "Narcissistic Personality Inventory", a measure that asks people to choose between 40 pairs of self-descriptive items, one of which is narcissistic in tone ("I will be a success") and the other not ("I am not too concerned about success"). Twenge's studies show that scores have risen among US college students over time. For example, she and her colleagues found that, among a 2009 cohort, almost two-thirds of undergraduates were more narcissistic than the cohort average from 1982.
Summarising her position in a 2013 review, Twenge concluded: "At the moment, the evidence clearly supports the view that today's young generation (born after 1980) is - at least compared to previous generations - more 'Generation Me' than 'Generation We'."
Others disagree, among them Jeffrey Arnett at Clark University, Worcester. He argues that US college students are hardly representative of young people as a whole and he also doubts whether the Narcissistic Personality Inventory really measures narcissism at all. For instance, the supposedly narcissistic option on the inventory could sometimes actually be a measure of benign, or harmless confidence - he points to examples such as "I am assertive" versus "I wish I were more assertive".
Millennials are an exceptionally generous generation that hold great promise for improving the world - Jeffrey Arnett
Citing the fact that the young are more likely to volunteer and more tolerant of diversity, Arnett says his view is directly the opposite of Twenge's: today's emerging adults are not only less narcissistic, they're "an exceptionally generous generation that holds great promise for improving the world".
In fact, there's mounting evidence that this might just be the case. Take a study which is about to be published in the journal Psychological Science. Personality expert Brent Roberts and his colleagues compared scores on the Narcissism Inventory among several cohorts of over 50,000 students who attended three American universities in three separate eras: the 1990s, 2000s and early 2010s. Unlike most of the earlier research, Roberts' team didn't just look at narcissism directly, but also other, related traits such as vanity, entitlement and leadership.
They also accounted for the fact that students from different generations may interpret the statements they were tested with differently. However the researchers sliced the data, they found the same pattern: narcissism has been declining among young people since the 90s.
In a press release, Roberts also added that older generations may have forgotten their own youthful narcissism; it fades with age. "We have faulty memories," he said, "so we don't remember that we were rather self-centered when we were that age."
Narcissism has been declining among young people since the 90s, according to one study
This also chimes with a new study just published in New Zealand, which found no evidence of rising entitlement, an aspect of narcissism, among millennials. Intriguingly, it also hinted that the higher sense of entitlement among younger people is a developmental effect, not a generational one. In other words, we generally feel less entitled as we get older.
For their part, Twenge and her colleagues are convinced that narcissism is on the rise. Among other things, they've discovered that more recent pop songs contain more words pertaining to self-focus compared to 80s hits, and that more individualistic words and phrases, such as "I am special", have been on the rise in books since 1960. They've even speculated that this same individualistic culture could be responsible for common names falling out of fashion with parents for their children.
These scholarly debates are raging against a backdrop of rising of social media use, selfies and the habit of constantly updating everyone else with what you're doing, thinking and feeling. It's hard to resist the conclusion that this technological and cultural change may be fostering a rise in vanity and narcissism.
Twenge has certainly made the link. In a 2013 article for the New York Times, she called social media a "narcissism enabler" but conceded that there is little evidence to show that social media actually causes narcissism. Indeed, accumulating data suggest that yes, narcissists are more likely to post selfies, but that doesn't mean that posting selfies makes you a narcissist. In fact, there's evidence that the more "agreeable" you are - trusting, warm and friendly - the more active you're likely to be on social media.
So much of the debate has been focused on narcissism, but what about the possibility that our characters are changing in positive ways? In fact, there is some good news.
Is social media a "narcissism enabler"?
Scientists have known for years that we're getting cleverer, by around three IQ points per decade.
It's called the Flynn Effect after James Flynn, an academic from New Zealand who first came up with the idea. Years of incremental improvements have added up to a substantial increase in intelligence test scores from the 1930s to the present day. Explanations range from a decline in infectious diseases to better schooling, but now scientists are wondering if a similar effect has been shaping personality traits, too.
A Finnish study released this year suggested that this might well be the case. The researchers, led by Markus Jokela at the University of Helsinki, analysed personality data from nearly half a million military conscripts born between 1962 and 1976, collected when they were aged 18 or 19. Jokela and his colleagues reported that over time, successive cohorts are scoring higher in extroversion-related traits, like sociability and being more energetic, and conscientiousness-related traits, like dutifulness and achievement striving.
Intriguingly, they also found evidence of rising self-confidence. This may corroborate the research on rising narcissism depending on whether the confidence is seen as healthy or not, which the Finnish data can't speak to.
It seems it may well be true that young people today are more self-assured than in previous generations. Whether you see that as a healthy sign of confidence or a worrying signal of narcissism may well say more about you than it does about them.

Lauren Greenfield is no stranger to excess. The American photographer and documentary filmmaker has spent the past quarter century chronicling displays of wealth, excess and global consumerism.
She has now compiled 25 years of these images into a major retrospective exhibition at the ICP Museum in New York, with more than 200 photographs depicting affluence and consumer culture around the world, and how they influence identity.
Greenfield's fascination with wealth and consumer culture began in Los Angeles in the early 1990s after she returned from an assignment to photograph a Mayan village in the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. She had studied visual anthropology and realised there was something compelling and exotic about the world she grew up in: the image-conscious young people of Los Angeles and how they were influenced by celebrity.
"What I remembered growing up was this very materialistic environment - somehow that was having influence all over the world.
"I felt like a serious documentary project about that world was important but was also more my story to tell."
Real estate billionaire Huang Qiaoling in front of his home, a replica of the White House, in Hangzhou, China in 2002.
With thin, white hair pinned to the side and thick glasses perched on the bridge of her nose, Ioanna Proiou slid her wrinkled, sun-spotted fingers over the strands of baby-blue wool stretched across her heavy wooden loom. She clanked a lever forward on the handmade machine again and again, a technique she has perfected over 90 years.
Do something in your life that stirs your passion
With that loom, Proiou creates the woven bags and clothing she sells from her little shop in Christos Raches, a village of 300 residents on the Greek island of Ikaria, a nine-hour ferry ride across the Aegean Sea from Athens. As her arms moved in rhythmic fashion, the loom shaking slightly, the 105-year-old told me how much she still loves her job.
"Do something in your life that stirs your passion," she advised me. "When my husband died decades ago, I continued doing what I love. Later, someone else proposed to me, but I said 'no'. I am married to my loom."

Not far from where Proiou sells her wares, Christos Raches' main square is quiet and calm. Locals sip coffee in the shade of leafy plane trees and exchange pleasantries outside their terracotta roofed homes. Business owners open and close their doors on no set schedule. Many of the shops operate on an honour system: customers take what they please and leave money on the counter in return.
It's a fairly common scene on the Greek islands, but Ikaria is different: here, one third of the island's population lives to be more than 90 years old. Along with Sardinia in Italy, Nicoya in Costa Rica, Okinawa in Japan and Loma Linda in California, Ikaria is a Blue Zone, one of five designated places where people live the longest.
Experts often cite a healthy diet and an active lifestyle as key to a longer life. The medical professionals and anthropologists associated with the Blue Zone project also note the importance of close family ties and involvement in faith-based communities. Ikarians make an effort to stay closely connected to their families and neighbours, and the elderly play significant roles in the community. Grandparents often help raise grandchildren or run businesses. But Proiou credits her longevity to her passion for weaving and her outlook on life. "Do not want more than what you really need. If you envy others, that can only give you stress," she told me.
Retired doctor Christodoulos Xenakis has another theory about how Ikarians avoid unnecessary anxiety. We met briefly during my first hour on the island and we had agreed to meet again, though tracking him down wasn't easy.
"No-one really sets appointments here," he shrugged when I greeted the 81 year old - who is considered a young man by Ikaria standards - a few days later in the village. Time is an important part of life on Ikaria, Xenakis explained, but not the way most people think. "It's more like 'see you in the morning, afternoon or evening'. We don't stress."
Ikarians spend their days with purpose
That's because, Xenakis said, Ikarians spend their days with purpose. He excitedly told me about his latest project organising the Ikaria Senior Regatta, a boat race for which the minimum qualifying age for captains is 70. Twenty participating crews sail a 14-nautical-mile route from neighbouring Samos island to Ikaria and back.
"It's not really a race," Xenakis said. "The regatta shows we can still do it and we are capable."
"There's always something to do with your time," he added. "But when you do things that make you happy or others happy, how can you not feel healthy, feel better or feel good?"

It is no secret that politicians often lie, but consider this ­- they can do so simply by telling the truth. Confused?
That statement becomes clearer when you realise that we've probably all done it. A classic example might be if your mum asks if you've finished your homework and you respond: "I've written an essay on Tennessee Williams for my English class." This may be true, but it doesn't actually answer the question about whether your homework was done. That essay could have been written long ago and you have misled your poor mother with a truthful statement. You might not have even started your homework yet.
Misleading by "telling the truth" is so pervasive in daily life that a new term has recently been coined to describe it: paltering. That it is so widespread in society now gives us more insight into the grey area between truth and lies, and perhaps even why we lie at all.
We lie all the time, despite the fact that it costs us considerably more mental effort to lie than to tell the truth. US president Abraham Lincoln once said that "no man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar".
I told her that she looked good when I thought that she looked like a blimp
In 1996 one researcher, Bella DePaulo even put a figure on it. She found that each of us lies about once or twice a day. She discovered this by asking participants for one week to note down each time they lied, even if they did so with a good intention. Out of the 147 participants in her original study, only seven said they didn't lie at all - and we can only guess if they were telling the truth.
Many of the lies were fairly innocent, or even kind, such as: "I told her that she looked good when I thought that she looked like a blimp." Some were to hide embarrassment, such as pretending a spouse had not been fired. DePaulo, a psychologist at the University of California Santa Barbara, says that the participants in her study were not aware of how many lies they told, partly because most were so "ordinary and so expected that we just don't notice them".
It is when individuals use lies to manipulate others or to purposely mislead that it is more worrying. And this happens more often than you might think.
When Todd Rogers and his colleagues were looking at how often politicians dodge questions during debates they realised something else was going on. By stating another truthful fact, they could get out of answering a question. They could even imply something was truthful when it was not. Politicians do this all the time, says Rogers, a behavioural scientist at Harvard Kennedy School. He and colleagues therefore set out to understand more about it.
He found that paltering was an extremely common tactic of negotiation. Over half the 184 business executives in his study admitted to using the tactic. The research also found that the person doing the paltering believed it was more ethical than lying outright.
The individuals who had been deceived, however, did not distinguish between lying and paltering. "It probably leads to too much paltering as communicators think that when disclosed, it will be somewhat ethical, whereas listeners see it as a lie," says Rogers.
It is also difficult to spot a misleading "fact" when we hear something that on the face of it, sounds true. For instance, the UK's Labour Party campaign video to lower the voting age said: "You're 16. Now you can get married, join the Army, work full-time." The BBC's reality check team discovered that these facts do not tell the whole truth.
"You can only join the Army aged 16 or 17 with your parents' permission," the Reality Check team wrote. "At that age you also need your parents' permission to get married unless you do so in Scotland. Since 2013, 16 and 17-year-olds cannot work full-time in England, but can in the other three home nations with some restrictions."
We want to achieve our narrow objective - [selling a house or car] - but we also want people to see us as ethical and honest
In another example, the then-presidential-nominee Donald Trump paltered during the presidential debates. He was questioned about a housing discrimination lawsuit early on in his career and stated that his company had given "no admission of guilt". While they may not have admitted it, an investigation by the New York Times found that his company did discriminate based on race.
And even if we do spot misleading truths, social norms can prevent us from challenging whether or not they are deceptive. Take a now infamous interview in the UK, where journalist Jeremy Paxman interviewed the politician Michael Howard (pictured below). He repeatedly asks Howard whether he "threatened to overrule" the then prisons governor. Howard in turn, continues to evade the question with other facts in a bizarre exchange that becomes increasingly awkward to watch. Not many of us are comfortable challenging someone in that way.
While it's common in politics, so too is it in everyday life. Consider the estate agent who tells a potential buyer that an unpopular property has had "lots of enquiries" when asked how many actual bids there have been. Or the used car salesman who says a car started up extremely well on a frosty morning, without disclosing that it broke down the week before. Both statements are true but mask the reality of the unpopular property and the dodgy car.
Paltering is perhaps so commonplace because it is seen as a useful tool. It happens because we constantly have so many competing goals, suggests Rogers. "We want to achieve our narrow objective - [selling a house or car] - but we also want people to see us as ethical and honest." He says these two goals are in tension and by paltering, people believe they are being more ethical than outright lying. "We show evidence they are making a mistake," says Rogers.
We can see the problems this sort of thinking can cause reflected in society today. The public are clearly sick of being lied to and trust in politicians is plummeting. One 2016 poll found that the British public trust politicians less than estate agents, bankers and journalists.
It's unethical and it makes our democracy worse. But it's how human cognition works
And despite the fact that we now frequently expect lies from those in power, it remains challenging to spot them in real time, especially so if they lie by paltering. Psychologist Robert Feldman, author of The Liar in Your Life, sees this as worrying both on a personal and on a macro level. "When we're lied to by people in power, it ruins our confidence in political institutions - it makes the population very cynical about [their] real motivations."
Lying can and does clearly serve a devious social purpose. It can help someone paint a better picture than the truth, or help a politician dodge an uncomfortable question. "It's unethical and it makes our democracy worse. But it's how human cognition works," says Rogers.
Unfortunately, the prevalence of lies might stem from the way we are brought up. Lies play a role in our social interactions from a very young age. We tell young children about tooth fairies and Santa, or encourage a child to be grateful for an unwanted present. "We give our kids very mixed messages," says Feldman. "What they ultimately learn is that even though honesty is the best policy, it's also at times fine and preferable to lie about things."
So next time you hear a fact that sounds odd, or someone to be deflecting a question, be aware that what you think is the truth may very well be deceptive.

We've all heard it before: to be successful, get out of bed early. After all, Apple CEO Tim Cook gets up at 3:45am, Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne at 3:30am and Richard Branson at 5:45am - and, as we know, "the early bird catches the worm."
But just because some successful people wake up early, does that mean it's a trait most of them share? And if the idea of having exercised, planned your day, eaten breakfast, visualised and done one task before 8am makes you want to roll over and hit snooze 'til next Saturday, are you really doomed to a less successful life?
Research shows that morning versus evening types show a classic left-brain versus right-brain division
For about half of us, this isn't really an issue. It's estimated that some 50% of the population isn't really morning or evening-oriented, but somewhere in the middle.
Roughly one in four of us, though, tend more toward bright-eyed early risers, and another one in four are night owls. For them, the effects can go beyond falling asleep in front of the TV at 10pm or being chronically late for work. Research shows that morning versus evening types show a classic left-brain versus right-brain division: more analytical and cooperative versus more imaginative and individualistic.
Morning people set higher goals for themselves, plan for the future more and have a better sense of well-being
Numerous studies have found that morning people are more persistent, self-directed and agreeable. They set higher goals for themselves, plan for the future more and have a better sense of well-being. And compared to night owls, they're less likely to be depressed, drink or smoke.
Although morning types may achieve more academically, night owls tend to perform better on measures of memory, processing speed and cognitive ability, even when they have to perform those tasks in the morning. Night-time people are also more open to new experiences and seek them out more. They may be more creative (although not always). And contrary to the maxim ('healthy, wealthy and wise'), one study showed that night owls are as healthy and wise as morning types - and a little bit wealthier.
Still think the morning people sound more like CEO material? Don't set your alarm for 5am just yet. As it turns out, overhauling your sleep times may not have much effect.
"If people are left to their naturally preferred times, they feel much better. They say that they are much more productive. The mental capacity they have is much broader," says Oxford University biologist Katharina Wulff, who studies chronobiology and sleep. On the other hand, she says, pushing people too far out of their natural preference can be harmful. When they wake early, for example, night owls are still producing melatonin. "Then you disrupt it and push the body to be in the daytime mode. That can have lots of negative physiological consequences," Wulff says, like a different sensitivity to insulin and glucose - which can cause weight gain.
Up to 47% of it is inherited, which means if you want to know why you pop up at dawn each day (or never do), you should probably look at your parents
In many ways, that makes sense, since research shows that our chronotype, or internal clock, is mainly biological. (Researchers even have found that the circadian rhythms of human cells in vitro correlate with the rhythms of the people they were taken from). Up to 47% of it is inherited, which means if you want to know why you pop up at dawn each day (or never do), you should probably look at your parents. One genetic factor seems to be the length of the circadian cycle: humans average a 24.2-hour clock, meaning everyone adjusts slightly each day to a 24-hour rhythm. But for night owls, the clock often runs longer - meaning that, without external cues to change, they'll fall asleep and get up later and later over time.
Your preference does change as you age. Children tend toward morning, with a peak shift toward night around age 20 and a slight change back toward morning at around age 50. But compared to your peers, you'll probably always fall within the same rough part of the spectrum.
Bright eyes
In our rush to figure out the 'secrets' of success, we tend to forget a couple of things. First, not all high achievers are early risers, and not all early risers are successful. (Famous late risers include Box CEO Aaron Levie and Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti, plus creatives like James Joyce, Gertrude Stein and Gustave Flaubert).
But more importantly, in a phrase beloved by academics everywhere, correlation isn't causation. In other words, it's not clear that waking up early itself provides the benefit. Instead, it may be that most of us are expected to start work or school by 8 or 9am. If you're a morning person, a combination of biological changes, from your hormones to body temperature, will get you up and at 'em way ahead of your night owl peers. That means people who enjoy rising early will be more aligned with their workday and likely to achieve more. For a night owl waking at 7am, her body still thinks she's asleep and is acting accordingly, so she's groggy for much longer than a morning person who wakes up at the same time.
It may also mean that they've had to figure out how to be more innovative and cut corners - which may encourage their creativity and cognitive skills
Researchers also point out that because evening types often have to function when their bodies don't want to, it makes sense that they may have worse moods or lower life satisfaction. It may also mean that they've had to figure out how to be more innovative and cut corners - which may encourage their creativity and cognitive skills.
Because the cultural stereotype is that people who go to bed and rise late are lazy, most people probably try to become morning people as much as they can. The only ones who don't may inherently have more rebellious, or individualistic, traits.
But shifting someone's chronotype doesn't necessarily change these traits. As one recent study found, even as people tried to become 'morning' people, it didn't make them have a better mood or life satisfaction, suggesting these traits are "intrinsic components of the late chronotype."
Other research also has hinted that your sleep preference may be biologically 'bundled' with other characteristics. In one recent study, for example, the University of Haifa's Neta Ram-Vlasov found that more visually-creative people had more sleep disturbances, such as waking several times at night or insomnia. Again, correlation isn't causation, she says. But there may be a connection to genetics. "There is a dopamine receptor gene that has been previously associated with both increased creativity and also with insomnia and sleep disturbance," she says.
Still think you'd be better off if you shifted to becoming a morning person? Morning exposure to bright (or natural) light, avoiding artificial light at night and carefully-timed melatonin intake can help. But because you're effectively overriding your biology, any changes take discipline and must be consistent to last. And because night owls tend to have a longer circadian cycle, putting them even more at odds with a 24-hour schedule, that can be tougher for them to achieve.
In real terms? "The normal person may be able to handle 1.5 hours and achieve a stable entrainment," says Wulff. Even that will require significant external input - like super-bright morning light (at least 2,000 lux), she says.
As long as that dawn wake-up isn't guaranteeing us CEO status, we think we'll hit snooze on any major changes to our schedule.

Media playback is not supported on this device England 30-6 Australia: Watch England's four tries as they beat Australia
England coach Eddie Jones shrugged off Australia counterpart Michael Cheika's concerns about some tight refereeing calls in his team's 30-6 win over the Wallabies at Twickenham.
Australia had two tries disallowed on video review and got two yellow cards.
Cheika queried the number of replays Irish video official Simon McDowell used to consider different incidents.
But Australian Jones said: "Why do we have a referee? Why do we have TMOs? How were we lucky?"
The Wallabies had wing Marika Koroibete's possible score chalked off for obstruction when they were trailing 13-6 in the 70th minute, with England scoring three tries before the final whistle to add gloss to the scoreline of an even encounter.
Autumn internationals 2017 England Wales Scotland Ireland 11 Nov Beat Argentina 21-8 Lost to Australia 21-29 Beat Samoa 44-38 Beat South Africa 38-3 18 Nov Beat Australia 30-6 Beat Georgia 13-6 Lost to New Zealand 17-22 Beat Fiji 23-20 25 Nov v Samoa v New Zealand v Australia v Argentina 2 Dec v South Africa
Earlier, Elliot Daly's 54th-minute score for the hosts was allowed to stand after replays were inconclusive as to whether Ben Youngs' kick ahead had strayed into touch in the build-up.
"I'm not sure who the TMO was, I probably should've found out his name. I'm just not sure about the process," said Cheika.
"How many replays for one incident? And how many replays for another? I don't know. He probably just makes his own mind up."
Jones comes out on top in 'arm wrestle'
Jones has taken his team from eighth in the world to second during his time in charge
England have won 21 of their 22 Tests since Jones took charge in December 2015 and he believes that a clinical edge combined with physical preparation was behind their latest victory.
"It was an arm wrestle," he said.
"You had to take your opportunities when they came about and we managed to take our opportunities better than them.
"We just stuck at it. I think we're fit. Our finishers did exceptionally well and we stuck to our gameplan, kept on turning them around and they fell apart at the end."
It is Jones' fifth successive win over his native country and, with the first Ashes Test five days away, the keen cricket fan was revelling in his own personal whitewash, even if his memory was a little inaccurate.
"The only time I've ever seen 5-0 before was in the '71 cricket," he said.
"Do you remember that series? John Snow (the England fast bowler), Australia got absolutely demolished. "
The victorious England side, captained by Ray Illingworth, actually won the seven-match Ashes series in 1971-72, 2-0.
Cheika 'abused' by Twickenham spectators
Cheika appeared angered as he headed to the dressing room at half-time
When Kurtley Beale followed Michael Hooper to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on just before half-time, Cheika headed straight from his coaching box in the stands down to pitchside.
On his way, he appeared to argue with spectators, and the Wallabies coach claimed several fans had aimed insults at him.
"There are plenty of fans giving me a gob-full, I can assure you. And it's not nice, not pleasant. But that is the way it goes.
"I know when I walk down the stairs that I'm going to cop abuse.
"Is this what rugby has come to? That we're just looking for all of that?"
Analysis
Former England centre and World Cup winner Mike Tindall:
Both sides got a few harsh calls against them but I think we edged it on the good calls.
We did thoroughly deserve the win. I think it is a little bit of a flattering scoreline.
I think the Michael Hooper yellow card seemed a little bit harsh. With their tries that were disallowed, I think technically to the letter of the law they were probably all the right calls.

James Pockett: What happened to calling the referee Sir and his word being final? Both sides at it.

Frampton was given a stern test by his former sparring partner on his return to the ring
Carl Frampton secured a hard-fought points win over Mexican Horacio Garcia at the SSE Arena on his return to the ring after 10 months out of action.
The Belfast boxer was made to battle all the way but was awarded a unanimous decision on the judges' scorecards.
The two-weight world champion was fighting for the first time since his split from Barry McGuigan's Cyclone Promotions during the summer.
It was also his first contest since losing his WBA title to Leo Santa Cruz.
The bout was fought at a frantic pace but Frampton emerged victorious to clinch a 24th win from his 25 professional contests.
The Northern Irishman is now under the management of Frank Warren and had trainer Jamie Moore in his corner for the first time but was provided with a stern test as he attempts to get back into contention for a world title.
Frampton, fighting in his native city for the first time in almost three years, was awarded the victory 98-93, 97-93 and 96-93 by the three judges.
Garcia, 27, suffered a fourth defeat of his career but put up a gutsy performance as he absorbed some hard shots from his former sparring partner in his first fight outside Europe.
Frampton was forced to take a count from referee Victor Loughlin in the seventh round despite having appeared to lose his balance.

Belfast title fight the target
The 30-year-old is now set to fight again in the spring, before targeting a long-awaited world title fight at Windsor Park in Belfast next summer.
"It was a good fight for the fans. I boxed well for the first few rounds but then got myself caught up in a fight," said Frampton.
"I wanted a hard fight for my comeback and that's what I got. The rust is off, the cobwebs are gone and now I want to fight one of the big guys."
Frampton had lost his WBA featherweight belt to Santa Cruz in Las Vegas last January as the Mexican avenged his defeat of six months earlier.
That reverse ended Frampton's perfect professional career record, which included winning both the IBF and WBA super-bantamweight titles following wins over Kiko Martinez and Scott Quigg.
Last July, Frampton's planned return to the ring unravelled in dramatic fashion as his scheduled opponent, another Mexican Andres Gutierrez, injured himself while slipping in the shower the evening before the fight,
Hours earlier, Frampton had failed to make the featherweight limit for the bout, although the contest was still scheduled to go ahead despite the weight mishap.
Within a couple of weeks, Frampton's split with long-time promoter and manager McGuigan was revealed.

Most of these war ships were built to fight in World War I, but were completed too late to play a major role. Now, they are serving a new purpose.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Eclectus parrots were found in a sorry state, squashed into drainage pipes
A wildlife raid in Indonesia yielded startling results after 125 exotic birds were found squashed into pipes.
Police say 84 eclectus parrots and 41 endangered white cockatoos were stuffed into drain pipes sealed by wire.
Indonesia's vast jungles are home to many threatened bird species. The country is trying to rein in a rampant wildlife trade.
Separate raids were conducted in parts of eastern Indonesia, leading to the arrests of four men.
If found guilty, they face jail sentences of up to five years and fines of 100m Rupiah ($7,400; £5,600).
Indonesia is home to a large-scale illegal trade of birds, many of which find themselves sold in giant avian markets.
Many poached birds are also smuggled abroad.
Dwi Adhiasto of the Wildlife Conservation Society believes the birds uncovered from Monday's raid were on their way to the Philippines, given links to "a parrot smuggling network there".
Image copyright AFP Image caption The birds, believed to have been caught by poachers, were bound for the illegal wildlife trade
Native to Indonesia's North Maluku province, white cockatoos are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
The IUCN says there are between 43,000 and 183,000 white cockatoos left in the world - but their numbers are falling due to bird poaching and trapping, and destruction of their natural habitats.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Parasites like tapeworms (file pic) can live inside people's digestive tracts
A North Korean soldier who was shot while fleeing across the border has an extremely high level of parasites in his intestines, his doctors say.
The defector crossed the demilitarised zone on Monday, but was shot several times by North Korean border guards.
Doctors say the patient is stable - but "an enormous number" of worms in his body are contaminating his wounds and making his situation worse.
His condition is thought to give a rare insight into life in North Korea.
"I've never seen anything like this in my 20 years as a physician," South Korean doctor Lee Cook-jong told journalists, explaining that the longest worm removed from the patient's intestines was 27cm (11in) long.
What does it tell us about N Korea's standards of health?
"North Korea is a very poor country and like any other poor country it has serious health problems," Prof Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul told the BBC.
"North Korea does not have the resources to have a modern medical system," he says. "Its doctors are relatively poorly trained and have to work with primitive equipment."
In 2015 South Korean researchers studied the health records of North Korean defectors who had visited a hospital in Cheonan between 2006 and 2014.
They found that they showed higher rates of chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, tuberculosis and parasite infections, compared to South Koreans.
"I don't know what is happening in North Korea, but I found many parasites when examining other defectors," Professor Seong Min of Dankook University Medical School was quoted by the Korea Biomedical Review as saying.
But Prof Lankov points out that compared with other countries with a similar per capita income - like Bangladesh or many African countries - the population in North Korea is healthier than one would expect. The country's life expectancy is well above average considering the level of economic poverty, he says.

Are the parasites endangering the soldier?
Yes. Considering that he is already in a critical condition, they are making a bad situation much worse.
The soldier was shot at least six times when North Korean border guards opened fire on him as he ran across the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom to the South Korean side.
The young soldier was rushed by helicopter to a hospital in South Korea and has undergone emergency surgery.
Doctors say there is a severe contamination of the wounds by both parasites and faeces.
"We are paying close attention to prevent possible complications," surgeon Lee Cook-jong told reporters, explaining that "an enormous number of parasites" including roundworms had been found in the small intestine.
How do you get a parasite?
Humans can get parasites through eating contaminated food, by being bitten by an insect or by the parasite entering through the skin.
In the case of the North Korean defector, the first case is most likely. Parasites which enter the body via contaminated food are often worms.
The soldier's food may have been contaminated because the North still uses human faeces as fertiliser, known as "night soil".
Lee Min-bok, a North Korean agriculture expert, told Reuters: "Chemical fertiliser was supplied by the state until the 1970s. By the 1990s, the state could not supply it any more, so farmers started to use a lot of night soil instead."
If these faeces are untreated and fertilise vegetables that are later eaten uncooked, the parasites get into the mouth and the intestines of the person.
While some don't cause any severe symptoms, others can be life-threatening, explains Prof Peter Preiser from the School of Biological Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
"What they all do is take nutrients away from your body," he told the BBC. "So [even] if most of them might go unnoticed, they all indicate a poor health status. To put it simply: people who have parasites are not healthy."
Image copyright EPA Image caption Surgeon Lee Cook-jong said he'd never seen that many parasites
If the intestines are disrupted and parasites are released into the body cavity, they can be a lot more dangerous and much more complicated to treat.
Also, he is likely to have had the parasites for a long time. This means "that patient will generally be in a weaker state so any wounds and surgery will become more dangerous," explains Prof Preiser.
Is this a problem particular to North Korea?
Parasites, especially worms, are thought to be widespread in North Korea. However, they also affect many developing countries where diets include uncooked vegetables fertilised with faeces.
There are ways to treat faeces so they can be used as a safe fertiliser, but many poor countries neglect to do so. Prof Lankov says this seems to be the case in North Korea.
The poor health and nutrition has widespread consequences "but North Korea does not admit this because they fear this will affect their image too much".
Should there ever be a reunification of the two Koreas though, there would be massive health problems for officials to deal with for decades to come, Prof Lankov warns.
At the height of swinging London in the 1960s, young singer-songwriter and actress Marianne Faithfull found herself at a short-lived Soho nightclub called Vesuvio, alongside her boyfriend Mick Jagger. This hotspot was owned by an infamous character called Spanish Tony; the night attracted the generation's cultural superstars, and Faithfull was, characteristically, at the heart of the scene.
"It was pretty much of a dive, but the people there were just stupendous: le tout Londres hip," recounts Faithfull in her memoir, Memories Dreams & Reflections (2007). "All the Beatles, most of the Stones, a few Whos, spangled guitar slingers, mangled drummers were there - in short, anybody who was anybody, or thought they were. The punch had, of course, been spiked with LSD."
Faithfull was, in many ways, a wide-eyed poster girl for the Swinging Sixties: that era of high times, bold style and wild possibilities. Born in Hampstead (to a British military spy turned academic father, and a mother who descended from Austro-Hungarian nobility), she had been 'discovered' at 16 by The Rolling Stones' flamboyant manager, Andrew Loog Oldham. Her first major single, the sweetly dreamy As Tears Go By (written by Jagger and Oldham with the Stones' guitarist Keith Richards), propelled her from playing London's folk clubs to mainstream chart stardom.
Success seemed entwined with excess in that decade. The Swinging Sixties summoned a whirlwind of 'free love', rock'n'roll and experimental drugs - and Faithfull initially seemed in her glamorous element: a talented, convent school-educated beauty and hit-maker (who recorded in English, French and German) on escapades with the likes of the Stones and Anita Pallenberg (another It Girl and sometime love rival). At the same time, a judgemental streak and salacious bent lingered in British society; famous women would bear the brunt of this much more sharply than their male counterparts - as proved by the notorious police raid on a party at Richards's Sussex home, Redlands, in 1967.
Double standards
Jagger and Richards were tried and found guilty of drug possession; Faithfull's public treatment was undeniably more damaging. The press slavered over reports that the 20-year-old had been caught at Redlands wearing only a fur rug (she's pictured during the court trial, carrying a copy of the London Evening News with the headline 'Naked girl at Stones party'); the ensuing scandal and sexual myths would haunt her from here. "To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorizing," Faithfull would later tell AN Holmes in Detailsmagazine (1994). "A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother."
Of course, Faithfull was never easy to categorise; even her youthful acting work was intensely varied, from the cult erotica of The Girl On A Motorcycle (with Alain Delon, 1968) to Ophelia in Tony Richardson's 1969 version of Hamlet (her understudy was Anjelica Huston). But this It Girl's comedown, when it came, was harshly documented.
Faithfull hit rock bottom, yet somehow, she did not fade away
In 1970, she left Jagger, after suffering a miscarriage, and also losing custody of her infant son to her ex-husband, artist John Dunbar; she had also attempted suicide, taking 150 Tuinals on a flight to Sydney, shortly after the death of Stones' founder Brian Jones. Faithfull's rejection of the 'goldfish bowl' of superstardom led into murkier waters, as she became a homeless, anorexic junkie in Soho: London's playground turned purgatory.
Faithfull hit rock bottom, yet somehow, she did not fade away: "People looked after me, the meths drinkers, junkies," she recalled. "I learned that human beings are really all right. I didn't know that from my posh life in the 60s. It was very bitchy and people were cruel to each other. I was on the street for two years, but it was better than staying at my mother's and being under her thumb."
Musical muse
In retrospect, even this nightmarish haze seemed to yield creative sparks; Faithfull was credited with inspiring several iconic Stones tracks, including Wild Horsesand I Got The Blues(from 1971's Sticky Fingers album, also featuring Sister Morphine, which she co-wrote) - she had also previously introduced Jagger to literary influences, including Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master And Margarita, which led to his writing Sympathy For The Devil. She duetted with David Bowie (she in a nun's habit, he as Ziggy Stardust), covering I Got You, Babe on NBC TV in 1973. She also recorded works by Bob Dylan and Sandy Denny for Rich Kid Blues (recorded in 1971 and released in 1985), and explored country influences on 1976's Dreamin' My Dreams.
By 1979, punk was disrupting pop culture, political turmoil loomed, and Faithfull (then married to Ben Brierley from The Vibrators), released her benchmark album, the Grammy-nominated Broken English. This collection was edgy and artful, with an electro-edged title track partly inspired by Ulrike Meinhof, accompanying videos by Derek Jarman, and uncompromising lyrics. Three decades on, Broken English retains a startling potency; on the credits for its 2013 deluxe edition, Faithfull admits: "I thought I was going to die, that this was my last chance to make a record. I'm going to show you bastards who I am."
Faithfull was never a mere adornment in the 60s; in the 21st Century, she remains a creative muse
Few artists' voices have weathered so openly or vividly as Faithfull's, from her sweetly girlish 60s recordings, to the much smokier, huskier tones of her later works. She has arguably put this transformation to powerful effect, musically. These days, the notion that a singer "makes a song their own" might sound like a throwaway comment on a TV talent show, but Faithfull really does draw intensely intimate connections, whether it's her raw interpretations of Weimar Republic cabaret (20th Century Blues, 1997), or the title track of her 1999 album, Vagabond Ways. She has continued to blur genres, collaborating with Roger Waters (playing the matriarch in his 1990 revival of The Wall), as well as hard rock acts Oxbow and Metallica.
It is hard to think of anyone else who could be equally at home discussing poetry with Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, hanging out at Donatella Versace's apartment with Kate Moss and Cher, or guest-starring as 'God' (to Anita Pallenberg's 'Devil') in the TV sitcom Absolutely Fabulous (2001). Faithfull was never a mere adornment in the 60s; in the 21st Century, she remains a creative muse, collaborating with the likes of PJ Harvey, Anna Calvi, Damon Albarn, Beck, and Nick Cave. This self-styled 'fabulous beast' has endured health issues, and accomplished victories, including her Icon Of The Year award from British music magazine Q in 2009. In 2013, she told The Guardian: "I recently looked at my Austrian-Hungarian family tree - my great-great-uncle Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Venus In Furs, and all that. I don't think I had any choice, really, but to be very decadent."
Faithfull is due to start recording her next album in January 2018; this will be her 21st solo record, following 2014's Give My Love To London. Her legacy certainly casts her as an It Girl archetype, yet she is also a shape-shifting figure akin to Virginia Woolf's Orlando: she belongs to each era, then she transcends it completely. Faithfull is the enfant terrible, the grande dame, the flawed sage, and anything she damn well likes.

Seventy years ago, a young British couple was shot dead at a mission hospital in Kashmir, making orphans of their three sons - one only two weeks old. To mark the anniversary two of those sons, now white-haired, made a personal pilgrimage to the spot.
"I feel very emotional to be here," says Doug Dykes, standing yards from the veranda where his mother and father suffered fatal bullet wounds when he was two years old.
"I saw my parents being killed - that's what I've been told. My father tried to stop the attackers approaching the nuns and he was shot. I ran screaming towards my father. My mother ran after me - and then she was also shot."
There's a touch of anguish in his recollections - a sense that he may in some way have been responsible for the death of his mother.
Image caption James (left) and Doug Dykes at the graveside
We are standing by his parents' graves in this remote corner of the Kashmir valley, the headstones shaded by recently harvested apple and walnut trees.
It may seem like a tranquil spot, but Tom and Biddy Dykes, an army officer and his wife, were killed in the opening salvos of the Kashmir crisis - and 70 years later the conflict continues to claim lives just about every day.
In all, six people lost their lives at St Joseph's Catholic mission in the riverside town of Baramulla on that October morning in 1947. Jose Barretto, the husband of the hospital doctor, tried to save the nuns who ran the mission and was put up against a tree and shot. A nurse, Philomena, died seeking to protect the patients. Motia Devi Kapoor, a patient, was stabbed to death in her hospital bed.
Image caption Tom and Biddy Dykes on their wedding day in 1940
The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary also lost one of their own - Sister Teresalina, a newly-arrived Spanish nun in her 20s. She leapt in front of the convent's Belgian mother superior, taking a bullet intended for the older woman. She is buried in the nuns' graveyard on the other side of the mission grounds.
All were murdered by armed tribesmen from Pakistan who invaded Kashmir to try to prevent the princely state becoming part of India after the British withdrawal - and to take away as much loot as they could carry. As they ransacked St Joseph's on 27 October 1947 the first Indian troops were landing in Kashmir to repulse the invaders - and they have been here ever since to prevent the region being seized by Pakistan, which claims it as its own.
Security concerns were the main reason why the oldest of the three Dykes children, named Tom like his father, never managed to revisit Baramulla before his death in 2003.
When I met him a few years earlier his recollections of the attack were extraordinarily vivid.
"I can remember waking up, and there was gunfire all around the place," he told me.
"Then these fellows that had raided the hospital started to batter down the door of the room we were in. The splinters started to fly across the room, and I could see the wild faces through the cracks in the door.
"The tribesmen were looting the place, they were pulling everything apart, and putting their booty into sheets which lay on the floor and were made up into bundles."
Image caption Biddy Dykes
A family servant managed to take the five-year-old away from the marauders. A little later they returned to see if they could find Tom's family.
"We went back to the central part of the hospital, a garden area with a path around it. And we came across these bodies, covered with blood. And sitting on top, howling his eyes out, was my little brother Douglas."
I stumbled on this story when, 20 years ago, I met the last remaining nun who had survived the ordeal. Sister Emilia, an Italian, recounted how the tribesmen had climbed over the mission walls, smashed through locked doors and manhandled some of the nuns. After they killed her friend - the new Spanish sister, Teresalina - Emilia thought she too was about to die.

The hospital run by the 16 nuns had a high reputation. Biddy Dykes - a motherly woman with a "round, happy face darkish hair and a lovely smile", in the description of another army wife - went there to give birth to at least two of her sons.
Their father was a Sandhurst-trained soldier from a family with a tradition of service in the British Indian army. He married Biddy, a military nurse, at Agra, the city of the Taj Mahal, in 1940, and had risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel by the end of World War Two. When the British pulled out of India in August 1947, he agreed to stay on for a few months as an officer in the Indian army's Sikh Regiment to help the transition.

The family has an anguished letter Biddy Dykes wrote 10 days before she died, shortly after giving birth to her third son, James. The security situation was alarming and she was desperately waiting for her husband to turn up and get them out.
"Hells Bells, I'd give anything to see Tom walk in this evening," she wrote. "He said in one letter that he'd be up here today. But I don't think there is an earthly chance."
In fact, Dykes did make it to Baramulla but was unable to get his family to safety.
A letter has emerged that he wrote after his arrival to a British officer in the Kashmiri capital, Srinagar, just 30 miles away. In it he explains that he has come to collect his family only to be "overtaken by the present events", in his astonishingly understated words. In clipped military fashion, he writes: "I should be most grateful if you would send a vehicle here to Baramulla to collect us." With an invasion underway, the evacuation was impractical. Two days later, he and his wife were dead.
The three orphaned Dykes boys along with about 70 others were held captive in a single hospital ward for 10 days, while war raged around them. The Indian air force repeatedly bombed the mission, which the Pakistani invaders were using as a transport and supplies depot.
The two older boys eventually returned to Britain by boat. James, the baby, was so weak he was not expected to survive. He was initially cared for by Lady Messervy, the wife of the British general who had become the first commander-in-chief of the Pakistan army, and slowly began to improve. When, a few months later, he was well enough to make the journey home, he was taken in by a different wing of the family. He didn't see a lot of his older brothers as they were growing up and at 18 he emigrated to South Africa.

"We never talked much about our parents - we knew the bare facts of what happened, but we were encouraged not to dwell on it," says Doug Dykes, a brewer by profession who lives in Dorking, just outside London. It was only when I made contact with the family, sent photos of the graves and sought their testimony, that the brothers started to talk among themselves about their memories and feelings, he tells me.
St Joseph's lies at the western end of Indian-administered Kashmir, where the mountains start to close in on the valley. The road from the Kashmiri capital, Srinagar, is lined by Indian army bases and choked with the incessant movement of the huge numbers of troops deployed to ensure that neither Pakistan nor Kashmiri separatists prise the region from Indian control.
Today there are 13 nuns at St Joseph's, all Indian - though none Kashmiri. In 1947 all except one were from Europe. As well as the small hospital - now, as then, specialising in maternal and women's health - they run a nursing institute which is currently training 67 local Kashmiri girls. The nuns recount how at times in recent years, as the security situation worsened, they have been encouraged to pull out of Baramulla. But they have insisted on staying. The service they provide to the local community is clearly appreciated, as is the evident compassion with which they conduct their mission.
For the 70th anniversary of the killings, the nuns took it on themselves to organise a memorial mass, candle-bearing processions and the laying of wreaths to honour those who lost their lives. They invited the two surviving Dykes children to attend and asked if I would come along too.
The army has spruced up the graves for the occasion - a touch of whitewash, a few additional pot plants and camouflage sheets to protect those gathering around the graves. The quiet of the occasion is broken by the whirr of an army surveillance drone overhead, keeping an eye out for intruders.

Col Dykes lies in the only Commonwealth war grave in Kashmir, and the top-ranking Indian general in the area places a wreath, as does the diocesan bishop and the provincial head of the nuns' order. The Dykes sons both lay wreaths too - Doug makes a point of honouring his mother.
For Doug and James Dykes, the warmth of the welcome from the nuns and the poignancy of the ceremonies is overpowering.
James, who stayed in South Africa and made a career as a tax consultant, is able to visit the room where his mother gave birth to him, as well as seeing the spot his parents were buried just two weeks later.
"I'm gobsmacked by it all. I just can't find the words," he says.
"I never expected to make it here."
Neither of the surviving brothers can be sure to make it to Kashmir again. It was a precious chance - possibly a last chance - to get close to the young couple who died here, and whom they have thought about all their lives.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: See the new Tesla Semi and Roadster
Tesla has unveiled its first electric articulated lorry, designed to challenge diesel trucks as king of the road.
The long-anticipated Tesla Semi has a range of 500 miles on a single charge.
Tesla says the vehicle - known in the US as a semi-trailer truck - will go into production in 2019.
Chief executive Elon Musk also unexpectedly revealed a new Roadster, which he said would be "the fastest production car ever" made.
The red sports car was driven out of the trailer of the electric lorry during Tesla's presentation on Thursday.
The Roadster will have a range of close to 1,000km (620 miles) on a single charge and will do 0-100mph in 4.2 seconds.
Mr Musk described it as "a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars".
He said riding in traditional cars would be like driving "a steam engine with a side of quiche". The new Roadster becomes available in 2020.
Image copyright Tesla
The Tesla Semi will achieve 0-60mph in 20 seconds when pulling 36,287kgs (80,000lbs), the maximum allowed on US roads.
Speaking on stage at Tesla's facility in Los Angeles, chief executive Elon Musk said: "It's not like any truck that you've ever driven."
However, the charismatic Mr Musk faces continued pressure from investors and customers as the firm struggles to meet demand for its Model 3 car.
Model 3 delays
The Model 3 is behind schedule due to factory delays, a situation Mr Musk described recently as "production hell".
The 46-year-old had been camping at Tesla's Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada, to oversee battery production for the new cars. However, while the company had predicted it would make 1,500 Model 3 cars in the third quarter of 2017, in reality it only managed 260.
Image copyright Tesla Image caption Tesla said it won't reach its production target of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week until 2018
Depending on your opinion of Mr Musk, launching a new truck at this time is either a bold statement of belief in his technology, and business as usual, or a foolish distraction from Tesla's main goal of making its Model 3 a mainstream, affordable car.
There are elements of the Model 3 in the Tesla Semi. Each of its wheels is powered by a Model 3 motor, and the cab features two of the touch screens displays found in the Model 3.
Competitive market
With Tesla Semi, Mr Musk enters a competitive, demanding market. There are an estimated 3.5 million truck drivers in the US, the vast majority of whom drive diesel-powered engines. Tesla will not be able to compete on diesel's range, and battery specialists doubt Tesla can produce a powerful enough battery at a reasonable price.
"A 300-mile-capable battery pack costs about $200,000," a Carnegie Mellon study concluded.
"Which is much higher than a diesel-powered semi-truck, which costs about $120,000, on average, for the entire vehicle."
Image copyright Tesla
Mr Musk said the Tesla Semi would be able to travel 643km (400 miles) after 30 minutes of charge at one of Tesla's new mega-chargers.
The cost?
As for cost, the company said that per mile the Tesla Semi would work out cheaper than a diesel equivalent when fuel and other maintenance is taken into consideration - but did not share the cost of an individual truck.
The Diesel Technology Forum, a non-profit trade group that promotes the use of diesel, said Tesla's announcement needed to be "evaluated in the context of reality".
"Diesel is the most energy efficient internal combustion engine," Allen Schaeffer, the forum's executive director.
"It has achieved dominance as the technology of choice in the trucking industry over many decades and challenges from many other fuel types.
"Still, today, diesel offers a unique combination of unmatched features: proven fuel efficiency, economical operation, power, reliability, durability, availability, easy access to fuelling and service facilities, and now near-zero emissions performance."
As well as coming up against diesel incumbents, Tesla also faces other electric rivals. Concept electric big rigs have been unveiled by Daimler, Volkswagen and Cummins - though all fall short on range, and none are currently on the roads.
Where Tesla believes it can bring an added advantage is with on-board safety and comfort.
A statement from Tesla boasted that "jackknifing is prevented due to the Semi's onboard sensors that detect instability and react with positive or negative torque to each wheel while independently actuating all brakes".
"The surround cameras aid object detection and minimise blind spots, automatically alerting the driver to safety hazards and obstacles.
"With Enhanced Autopilot, the Tesla Semi features Automatic Emergency Braking, Automatic Lane Keeping and Lane Departure Warning."
Autopilot is Tesla's autonomous driving function that offers several self-driving features, most importantly guiding the vehicle to stay within the lines on the road, and slowing down in keeping with traffic up ahead.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Republicans are poised to pass the most sweeping rewrite of the US tax code since 1986
House Republicans have passed a controversial overhaul of the US tax code that slashes corporate rates.
Thursday's vote came after US President Donald Trump made a rare visit to Congress to rally lawmakers around the tax overhaul plan.
The Senate is working to build support for its own version of the bill, but one Republican has said he is a 'no'.
The plan also faces stiff opposition from the Democrats, who say it is a give-away to the wealthiest Americans.
The Republicans' attempts to pass the most significant overhaul of the US tax code since 1986 are a critical test for the party and president.
Republicans have called for changes to the code for years, but did not have support from the White House until President Trump's election.
He has served as cheerleader-in-chief for the measure, calling the bill a "big, beautiful Christmas present" for families.
The bill cleared the House 227-205, without Democratic support. Thirteen Republicans also voted no.
Representative Paul Ryan, who leads Republicans in the House, called it a "historic day".
The White House celebrated the House vote as a "big step".
"A simple, fair, and competitive tax code will be rocket fuel for our economy, and it's within our reach," the press secretary said in a statement after the vote. "Now is the time to deliver."
What's the next step?
Analysts also expect Republicans in the Senate to pass the measure without Democratic votes and later reconcile the two versions.
But Republicans are facing some opponents within their own party, which could endanger the legislation's prospects.
Without Democratic support, the Senate can afford to lose only two Republican votes.
On Wednesday Senator Ron Johnson, from Wisconsin, said he does not support the bill and does not think it does enough to help small businesses.
What's in the plan?
Broadly speaking, the Republican proposal would slash the corporate rate from 35% to 20% and change how overseas profits and payment from overseas subsidiaries are taxed.
It would also eliminate a range of targeted benefits for individuals and families, in favour of boosting the amount people can deduct from their tax bill.
Supporters say the bill offers tax relief and will boost economic growth.
Republicans estimate that the average American family of four will see their taxes lowered by $1,182 (£895).
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption US President Donald Trump visits Capitol Hill to rally support for the Republican tax cuts
Critics say the biggest beneficiaries will be large firms and very wealthy families. While many households could see lower taxes at first, over time some of those benefits would expire.
Opponents say the new version does not do enough to simplify the tax code for businesses - one of the original goals of the reform - and they say the proposal is fiscally irresponsible.
The House plan would cost more than $1.4tn to 2027, while the Senate version would cost $1.5tn, according to estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation.
Republicans hungry for a win
By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington
After a frustrating year, Republicans desperately need a win - and on Thursday they took a significant step toward one. Clearing a tax bill through the House is just the first leg of an arduous journey for conservatives, however, and even success may come with a price.
The Senate is working on its own set of reforms and, if it can pass them (no small task, given their narrow majority), both chambers of Congress will have to negotiate a compromise bill.
If the finished product looks anything like the drafts, Republicans could be handing a potent campaign issue to Democrats in next year's midterm elections.
While corporate tax cuts will satisfy the conservative donor class, the fact that they are permanent while the personal breaks expire in eight years will make for devastating Democratic campaign commercials.
Add in that the Senate version undermines Obamacare reforms, some cherished tax deductions will be eliminated and middle-class Americans in states with high local or state taxes could see their net federal taxes go up, and it's a recipe for pain for Republicans in at-risk congressional districts.
For now, however, it seems to be full speed ahead.
How do House and Senate bills compare?
Image copyright HS2 Image caption Carillion is a member of consortium that is building parts of the HS2 rail link
Shares in Carillion, the UK's second-biggest construction firm, fell 48% on Friday after it issued its third profit warning since July and said it expected to breach its loan conditions.
The firm blamed slower asset sales and delays to a Middle East project.
Carillion is a major supplier to the government and helps to maintain schools and hospitals.
It is also part of a consortium building the £56bn HS2 high-speed rail link.
The latest announcement follows separate profit warnings issued in July and September this year.
In its latest update, the company said it might need "some form of recapitalisation" in order to revive its fortunes.
Interim chief executive Keith Cochrane said: "Whilst we continue to target cash collections, reduce costs, execute disposals and focus on delivering for our customers, it is clear that significant challenges remain and more needs to be done to reduce net debt and rebuild the balance sheet."
Carillion said profits for this year would be "materially lower than current market expectations", and it now expected average net borrowing in 2017 to be between £875m and £925m.
What is Carillion involved in?
HS2 and Crossrail
Battersea Power Station
Hundreds of UK schools
NHS services
Library of Birmingham
Aberdeen Bypass
Projects across the Middle East and Canada
Government 'supportive'
The company said that based on its latest forecasts it expected it would breach its financial covenants - agreements with its lenders - at the end of the year.
The Cabinet Office said it had been "kept informed" of steps taken by Carillion to restructure its business.
"We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress," a government spokesperson said.
The contractor plays an integral role in the UK's services industry. As well as HS2, it has worked or is working on Crossrail, Battersea Power Station, the Library of Birmingham, and hundreds of schools, where it provides facility management services.
It has also been involved in major projects across the Middle East that include the New York University in Abu Dhabi and the Royal Opera House of Oman.
Shares in the company have now fallen by about 90% this year.
"The company is admitting what we've all already suspected: it will need some sort of debt restructuring," said Sam Bland of JP Morgan. "More organic methods simply aren't going to be feasible".
"If debt restructuring happens, you have to presume that current shareholders would be left with very little value," he added.
In July this year, Carillion shares plunged after it had to set aside £845m in provisions and its chief executive, Richard Howson, stepped down.
At the time, the government was forced to seek assurances from Carillion's partners on the HS2 project that they could step in to complete the work if necessary.
Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC business editor
A high profile bust would come at a bad time for a government keen to big up its economic dynamism.
Next week's unveiling of its Industrial Strategy and the chancellor's Budget are expected to feature investment in housing and infrastructure.
Having the UK's second biggest construction firm go under would not improve the economic mood music.
The government is monitoring the situation but might find it hard to do more than that.
Some have said that Carillion is "too big to fail" but Carillion is not RBS and the Treasury might take the view it is "too small to save" and would prefer to let the market do its work.

'On the cheap'
Carillion has been scrambling to bolster its finances amid writedowns on some of its projects.
Last month, it resorted to selling its UK healthcare arm to public-services provider Serco for £50m. The sale amounted to "peanuts" considering it was a high-margin business, said Neil Wilson, an analyst at ETX Capital.
"Disposals aren't enough, particularly as Carillion is selling things on the cheap", he said.
He added: "Some investors might think this is the end, but Carillion is too big to fail.
"Government intervention is possible but this is a nightmare for ministers at such a sensitive moment for the economy".
Carillion has contracts in aviation, defence, retail, healthcare, education, oil and gas, and transport. On Wednesday, a Carillion joint venture signed a deal with Oman's Ministry of Health for a new hospital in Salalah which was valued at about £240m.
Other recent deals include a joint-venture contract with Network Rail that the company says could generate up to £260m in revenue over three years.
Mr Bland of JP Morgan said contracts that have hurt Carillion include a hospital in Liverpool, a bypass in Aberdeen and a tramway in Sheffield. All three projects experienced delays of at least a year.
"I don't think anyone's hopeful about Carillion," he said.

Norway's government has been told its state-run fund should drop its investments in oil and gas stocks.
Norges Bank manages Norway's $1 trillion (£758bn) sovereign wealth fund on behalf of the government.
It said the step would make the country "less vulnerable to a permanent drop in oil and gas prices", and its advice was not based on a price forecast or the sector's sustainability.
Around 6% of the fund, worth £28bn, is invested in oil and gas stocks.
"This advice is based exclusively on financial arguments and analyses of the government's total oil and gas exposure," said the bank's deputy governor Egil Matsen.
Norges Bank's proposal must now be reviewed by Norway's Finance Ministry, which has said it will announce its own view in the autumn of next year.
If it decides to back the central bank's proposal, the country's parliament would be able to vote on it in June 2019 at the earliest.
Norway is western Europe's biggest oil and gas producer and its sovereign wealth fund, known officially as the Government Pension Fund, is used to invest the proceeds of the country's oil industry.
But Norges Bank said that investing money back into the energy sector meant the government's exposure to the price of crude was too high, particularly given the country's majority stakes in Statoil ASA.

"There is a substantial difference... in return between the oil and gas sector and the broad stock market in periods when the oil price changes substantially.
"Oil price exposure of the government's wealth position can be reduced by not having the fund invested in oil and gas stocks," Mr Matsen said.
'No cause for concern'
Nonetheless, shares in major oil firms such as Shell, BP and Exxon Mobil all traded lower after the announcement.
And analysts warned that the central bank's proposal could have a knock-on effect on the sector.
"The risk for the oil sector is how many investment funds will downsize their exposure to extractive industries," said Jason Kenney, oil analyst at bank Santander.
But Quilter Cheviot analyst Liz Dhillon said the move was "no real cause for concern".
"Nothing is imminent and even if the advice is fully implemented we believe this will have limited impact on the oil and gas producers, as the holdings of Norges Bank are relatively small and no doubt will be disposed of over an extended time frame," she added.
Xavier Dolan was just 19 years old when he made his first feature film, going on to write and direct four more by the time he was 25.
"I was 19 or 20; you don't know who you are when you're 20," Dolan says. "Some people find that out by having a lot of different clothing styles and other people do it through making films."
The Death and Life of John F Donovan is the now-28-year-old French-Canadian director's first film in the English language. It has attracted a number of A-listers, including Jessica Chastain, Thandie Newton, Kit Harington and Natalie Portman.
"The most important and prominent part of me wants to understand other people and tell stories - their stories through my own voice, through my own understanding of what life is," Dolan says. Watch the video above to find out more.

The hero jumps through a glass window and escapes unscathed. A man smashes a beer bottle over the head of his nemesis. A woman hurls a glass vase at her paramour.
From The Wizard of Oz to the Wolf of Wall Street, smashing glass is a fixture of most Hollywood movies and TV shows.
And it's entrepreneurs with secret recipes that create the "breakaway" prop glass bottles and windows, which are brittle enough to shatter but safe enough to prevent lacerations to actors and stunt people.
In the past, movie glass props were prohibitively expensive for low budget projects.
But entrepreneur Ryan Johnson has created an affordable line of props to smash for theatres, film and television - and increasingly for YouTubers.
"We opened up a new market for ourselves especially in the smaller regional theatres and school theatres," says Mr Johnson, who is the president of the props and special effects company, NewRuleFX.

"Now they have props at a price point they can afford."
Mr Johnson says the "workhorse" of the breakaway industry is the standard brown beer bottle. He then allowed me to tick off a bucket list item and smash the bottle over his head. It shattered just like the real thing.
He flinched a bit but said it didn't hurt.
His firm makes the bottles seven days a week. Behind his showroom on a Sunday afternoon, one of his employees worked in "the top secret room" melting plastic resins and remoulding them into beer bottles.
NewRuleFX.com also makes foam frying pans, hammers and guns, and sells replica weapons and costumes to fans of Game of Thrones. It also makes electronic cigarettes without nicotine, which are increasingly popular with actors.
But the $13 (£10) beer bottle is the best seller.

"It's a very easy-to-use prop because it's kind of universal both in style and also time period. It hasn't changed much over the years. So you can buy our brown beer bottle and use it even for an older Western show."
Mr Johnson comes from a production background and still works occasionally on set. He started his props and special effects business in 2010, after the US recession and a writers' strike in Hollywood devastated the entertainment industry.
"My main business was doing TV commercial and infomercials," Mr Johnson says.
"When the recession hit a lot of the people that advertise on TV just said 'we're pulling back this year - we're not going to advertise on TV anymore'. And very quickly I realised I've got to do something else."
That something else was something he'd been tinkering with in his garage. During the writers' strike he mastered the recipe for his glass and created a website to market his creations.
Since then his small business has grown "10-15% per year" and he now employs seven people.

Despite losing some film and TV productions to other US states and countries with better tax breaks, Hollywood remains the beating heart of the global entertainment industry.
California's entertainment industry is the largest in the US. According to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the industry employed more than 198,000 people in the state in 2016.
The entertainment industry pays out $43bn a year to more than 300,000 businesses across the US - 85% of which are small businesses that employ fewer than 10 people, the association adds.
California's improved tax credits have also lured some productions back to the state.
Leron Gubler, the president and chief executive of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, says the majority of its members are small businesses that profit in some way from the entertainment industry.

Mr Gubler says the industry has changed over the last 25 years because studios do less in-house than they used to - which creates more opportunities for small businesses to work on studio productions.
"So much has changed," Mr Gubler says, noting how companies such as Netflix, Google and Amazon have created multiple new outlets for filmmakers through their streaming services.
"All these new platforms and tax cuts; there's so much opportunity for our members now," he says.
The secret to the success of his props business has been catering to every customer, he says.
Many of his competitors, he adds, don't want to bother selling a few props to kids making YouTube videos.
"I may spend 30 minutes on the phone talking them through the process and then they'll order from us, and say 'this is really cool'," he says.
"And then who knows, they may come back, and their career keeps growing, and eventually they become an art director on a Netflix show and they remain a loyal customer."
Sticking to this strategy has been integral to his success, he says.
"Treating every customer as if they were the biggest Hollywood show - we try very hard to do that."
